Before plans and \n","estimates are prepared, boundaries should be determined and the topography of the site \n","should be ascertained. After the plans are made, the structures must be stated out on the \n","ground. As the work progresses, lines and grades must be given.\n","2.3 oBJecTIveS of SUrveyINg\n","The main object of any survey is the preparation of a plan or a map showing all the features \n","of the area under consideration.
