    "text": "This branch of civil engineering deals with structural analysis and design of structures. fig 1.3 Reinforced Concrete Structures – Footings and Columns The object of structural analysis is to determine the internal forces and the corresponding displacements of all structural elements as well as those of the entire structural system. The safety and proper functioning of the structure can be ensured only through a thorough structural analysis. Structural engineering theory is based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural engineering design utilizes a number of relatively simple structural elements to build complex structural systems. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.5 fig 1.4 Reinforced Concrete Structures – Beams The aspects of analysis and design are as follows: Structural analysis is done to calculate stresses in structural components, on the • basis of loads acting on structures. Before building a structure, it should be analyzed and designed to decide about its • size to resist the possible forces coming on it. The structure should be safe and at the same time its components should be as • small as possible. Requirement of large column free structures gave rise to analysis and design of • shell roofs (curved surfaces), geodetic towers and tension structures. Up to mid-1960s, lot of improvements were seen in the classical methods of analysis. • Need of tall structures and improvements in computers gave rise to matrix method and finite element method of analysis. The role of structural engineers is as follows: Structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, • strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and nonbuilding structures.

    "text": "and rock mechanics to investigate subsurface conditions and materials. It deals with determination of the relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; evaluates stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits; assesses risks posed by site conditions. Soil investigation includes collection and testing of soil samples. Soils are considered as three-phase materials composed of rock or mineral particles, water and air. The voids of soil, the spaces in between mineral particles, contain water and air. The engineering properties of soils are affected by four main factors: the predominant size of the mineral particles, the type of mineral particles, the grain size distribution, and the relative quantities of mineral, water and air present in the soil matrix. Fine particles (fines) are defined as particles less than 0.075 mm in diameter. All structures have to finally transfer the load acting on them to soil safely. Soil property changes from place to place. Even in the same place it may not be uniform at different depth and in different seasons. Hence, a civil engineer has to properly investigate soil and decide about the safe load that can be spread on the soil. Geotechnical engineering includes measurement of soil parameters and safe bearing capacity. 1.1.6.2 Foundation Design Foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining walls. Apart from finding safe bearing capacity for foundation of buildings, geotechnical engineering involves various studies required for the design of pavements, tunnels, earthen dam, canals and earth retaining structures. It involves study of ground improvement techniques also. It also includes construction and design of simple foundations, pile foundations, well foundations, caissons, coffer dams, construction of foundation of dams, construction of tunnels, sub base of road, earthen dams, and earth related constructions. Sound knowledge of geology and geotechnical engineering is necessary for construction of earth related structures. Earthworks include embankments, tunnels, dikes and levees, channels, reservoirs, deposition of hazardous waste and sanitary landfills. Geotechnical engineering is also related to coastal and ocean engineering. Coastal engineering can involve the design and construction of wharves, marinas, and jetties. Ocean engineering can involve foundation and anchor systems for offshore structures such as oil platforms. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.7 The fields of geotechnical engineering and engineering geology are closely related, and have large areas of overlap. However, the field of geotechnical engineering is a specialty of engineering, whereas the field of engineering geology is a specialty of geology. fig 1.5 Cross Section of Foundation Geotechnical engineering is important in civil engineering, but it also has applications in military, mining, petroleum and other engineering disciplines that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground.",

Requirement of water in cities for domestic purpose and for industries is continuously increasing. Water resource engineering means measurement, utilization and development of water resources for agriculture, municipal and power generation purpose. Rural areas need water for agricultural field also. Hence, civil engineers have to look for new water resources and for storing them. It involves the design of new systems and equipment that help manage human water resources. Water resource engineering deals with planning, designing and developing water resources by constructing several hydraulic structures like dams, barrages, hydropower stations, canal and pipe networks, etc. Water stored in reservoirs by building bunds and dams should be brought to agricultural fields through canals and distributories. Study connected with this aspect is known as irrigation engineering. It also includes watershed planning, water harvesting techniques, soil conservation and soil reclamation.

    "text": "When water is required for drinking purpose, it should be purified and made potable. Purification of water and the technology involved in taking it to the houses is known as water supply engineering. Waste water and solid waste should be treated and disposed so that they do not create health hazard. This branch of civil engineering is known as sanitary engineering. The five essential requirements for human existence are air, water, food, heat and light. Contamination of these elements may cause serious health hazard not only to man but also to animal and plant life. The use of water by man, plants and animals is universal. Without it, there can be no life. Every living thing requires water. Man and animals not only consume water, but they also consume vegetation for their food. Vegetation, in turn, cannot grow without water. Growth of vegetation also depends upon bacterial action, while bacteria need water in order to thrive. The bacterial action can convert vegetable matter into productive soil. New plants, which grow in this soil, grow by sucking nutrients through their roots in the form of solution in water. Thus, an ecological chain is maintained. Water maintains an ecological balance, i.e., balance in the relationship between living things and environment in which they live. The use of water is increasing rapidly with our growing population. Already there are acute shortages of both surface and undergroundwaters in many parts of the country. Careless pollution and contamination of the streams, lakes, reservoirs, wells and other underground sources has greatly impaired the quality of available water. This pollution results because of improper disposal of waste water – both domestic as well as industrial. Organized community life requires twin services of water supply and sewage disposal. Good sanitation cannot be maintained without adequate water supply system. Without proper disposal, the wastes of a community can create intolerable nuisance, spread diseases and create other health hazards. The planning, designing, financing and operation of water and waste water systems are complex undertakings, and they require a high degree of skill and judgement.",

    "text": "to the public must be invariably free from all types of impurities both suspended and/ or dissolved in it, any kind of bacteria and any other contamination which may cause serious harm to the health of the public. It is therefore imperative to plan and build such a water supply scheme which would provide potable water free from any kind of contamination. In general, the water obtained from wells or springs, i.e., groundwater, is free from impurities and it may be supplied to public without adopting any method of purification. This is so because, in the course of its movement through the porous sub-strata, the water is completely relieved of its suspended impurities. However, before supplying to the public this water may have to be disinfected by chlorination (i.e., by adding chlorine or chlorine compound to water) or any other methods, in order to remove any harmful bacteria responsible for causing diseases. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.9 The Water obtained from any of the surface source needs to be purified before it can be supplied to the public. The most commonly adopted method of purification of water is filtration. In the process of filtration, water is allowed to pass through sand beds and gravel whereby minute suspended and dissolved particles are removed. It has been found that the process of filtration is greatly accelerated if water is pretreated with certain substances, which when added to water forms large masses of precipitates or flocs out of the impurities present which in the process settle down and are ultimately removed. This prefiltration treatment of water is known as coagulation which involves the use of alum. The water having undergone through the process of filtration is still found to contain some harmful disease producing bacteria which are minutely-sized living organisms not visible to naked eye. As such in order to ensure protected supplies of water free from any health hazard, it is necessary to kill these bacteria by disinfecting water. The most commonly adopted method of disinfecting is chlorination which is a process of adding chlorine or chlorine compound to water. Other methods of disinfecting water viz., treatments through ozone or ultraviolet rays or excess lime are also in use. Thus, it may be seen that a public water supply system should be such that it is able to provide an adequate and reliable supply of water catering to all the public needs and also ensure that the supplies so made are not only potable but also fully protected against any inflection which might pollute water and cause epidemics resulting in human suffering and loss.",

    "text": "classified into the following two categories: 1. Surface sources of water 2. Sub-surface or underground sources of water Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.10 fig 1.6 Cross Section of Storage Reservoir 1. Surface sources of water These are those sources of water which are available at the ground surface. The various sources of water included in this category are as follows: (a) Lakes and Ponds (b) Streams or rivers (c) Storage reservoirs (d) Oceans (a) Lakes and Ponds A large natural depression or hollow formed in the earth’s surface, which gets filled with water is called a lake. The surface runoff from the catchment area contributing to a lake enters the lake through small natural streams. The groundwater may also enter a lake through springs. The quantity of water available from a lake depends upon its size, catchment area, annual rainfall and geological formations. The quality of water available from a lake mainly depends upon the characteristics of its catchment. Thus water in a lake would be relatively pure and of good quality if it draws water from uninhabited upland hilly areas free from soluble salts. On the other hand the water in a lake would be contaminated if it draws from low land areas containing large quantities of soluble salts and other impurities. Moreover, a small lake containing still water may have plenty of algae, weed and other vegetable growth imparting bad smell, taste and colour to the water. Thus, if a sufficient quantity of good quality water is available from a lake then it will be a very useful source of water supply from which water may be supplied without any treatment or with some preliminary treatment. However, if the water Scope of Civil Engineering 1.11 in the lake is of relatively poor quality then it should be properly analyzed and treated before supplying to the public. A pond is a man-made body of standing water smaller than a lake . The ponds are formed by digging of ground and they are filled up with water in rainy season. The quantity of water in a pond is generally very small and often it contains many impurities. As such pond water is generally not suitable for drinking purposes and it can be used only for bathing, washing of clothes or for animals. (b) Streams or Rivers A stream or river is a natural channel which carries surface runoff received by it from its catchment or drainage basin. It also carries the groundwater flow added to it and the runoff resulting from the melted snow. Rivers are the most important sources of water supply. It is a well-known fact that several big and important cities of the world are situated on the banks of important rivers. Some of the examples in our country are the cities such as Delhi, Calcutta, Ahmedabad, etc. This is due to the availability of large quantity of the water from rivers for water supply throughout the year. The rivers may be either perennial or non-perennial. Perennial rivers are those in which water is available throughout the year. Such rivers are fed by rains during the rainy season and by melting of snow during the summer season. On the other hand, non-perennial rivers are those in which water is not available throughout the year. Generally, from perennial rivers, water may be utilized directly for public supplies without any arrangement for storage of water. However, if during dry weather periods, the flow in the river is considerably reduced, either the arrangement for raising the water level in the river or the arrangement for storage of water will have to be made to ensure the supply of water in the required quantity. This may be achieved either by constructing a weir or barrage, or by constructing a dam and creating a storage reservoir. Evidently, non-perennial rivers can be used for water supply only by providing necessary storage arrangements. Close to the point of origin in the mountains, the river water is fairly pure but as the river approaches plains, the quality of its water deteriorates considerably, because it picks up lot of suspended matter, clay, silt, etc., and becomes muddy appearances. Further, the disposal of the untreated or ever treated sewage into the river is liable to contaminate the river water. As such the river water must be properly analyzed and treated before supplying to the public. (c) Storage reservoirs The flow rate of a river or natural stream may vary considerably during different periods of the year. It may carry little or no water during dry weather periods and may carry huge amount of water during rainy season. Thus, if water is drawn directly from a river then during extremely low flows it may not be possible to meet the demands of the consumers, while during high flows there may be operational problems. As such it is essential to create a storage reservoir or an artificial lake by constructing a dam across the river, which can store excess water that flows in the river during the periods of high flows, for use during the periods of low flows or draughts. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.12 The quality of water in a storage reservoir mainly depends on the quality of the water flowing in the river on which the reservoir is created. As such the water from a storage reservoir also needs to be properly analyzed and treated before supplying to the public. The storage reservoirs are the main sources of water supply for big cities. However, the storage reservoirs are created not only for water supply but also for other purposes such as irrigation, hydropower generation, navigation, flood control, etc. A storage reservoir for supplying water for more than one purpose is termed as multipurpose reservoir. (d) Oceans Oceans carry huge amount of water which is estimated to be about 94 to 97 percent of the total quantity of water available on our planet Earth. However, the ocean water being highly saline cannot be used for water supply unless the excessive salt content of the water is removed. The process of removing salt from water is known as desalination and the salt free water so obtained is known as fresh water. As indicated, several methods of desalination have been developed later for the conversion of salt into fresh water. However, because of the tremendous cost involved, the procurement of fresh water for water supply by desalination of ocean water has not become common. 2. Sub-Surface or Underground sources of water The underground (or sub surface) sources of water are of the following four forms. (a) Infiltration galleries (b) Infiltration wells (c) Springs (d) Wells From each of the first three forms, relatively small quantity of groundwater is obtained and hence, these may be considered as the minor forms of underground sources of water. On the other hand, most of the groundwater is extracted from the last form viz., wells, and hence it is a major form of underground source of water. (a) Infiltration galleries. An infiltration gallery is horizontal or nearly horizontal tunnel usually rectangular in cross-section having permeable boundaries so that groundwater can infiltrate into the same, and hence it is also sometimes known as horizontal well. It is generally provided in highly permeable aquifers with high water table so that adequate head is available for gravity flow of groundwater into the gallery. It is frequently located near a perennial recharge source and hence, it is usually placed along the bank or under the bed of river. The usual depth at which the gallery is placed ranges from 3 to 10 m below the ground surface. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.13 fig 1.7 Cross Section of Infiltration Gallery (b) Infiltration wells. Infiltration wells are the shallow wells constructed in series along the banks of river to collect the water seeping through the banks of the river. The wells are closed at top and open at bottom. These wells are constructed of brick masonry with open joints. For the purpose of inspection, manhole is provided in the top cover of the well. The water infiltrates through the bottom of these wells and as it has to pass through sand bed it gets purified to some extent. The various infiltration wells are connected by porous pipes to a collecting sump well known as jack well. The water collected in the infiltration wells flows by gravity into the jack well. The water from the jack well is pumped to treatment plant and supplied to the consumers. (c) Springs. A spring is natural outflow of groundwater which appears at the ground surface as a current or stream of flowing water. Springs may be classified into (i) those resulting from gravitational forces, and (ii) those resulting from non- gravitational forces. (i) Gravity springs results from water flowing under hydrostatic pressure. The following are the different types of gravity springs. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.14 (a) Depression springs. These springs are formed due to overflowing of the water table, where the ground intersects the water table. The flow from such a spring is variable with the rise or fall of water table and hence in order to meet with such fluctuations, a deep trench may be constructed near such a spring. The deeper is the trench, the greater is the certainty of continuous flow because the saturated ground above the elevation of the trench bottom will act as a storage reservoir to compensate for the fluctuations of the water table. (b) Contact springs of surface springs. These springs are created by a permeable water bearing formation overlying a less permeable or impermeable formation that intersects the ground surface. However, in such springs, because of the relatively small amount of underground storage available above the elevation of the overflow crest, the flow from them is uncertain and is likely to cease after a drought. As such, these springs can also be developed by the construction of a cutoff trench or a cutoff wall. (c) Artesian springs. These springs result from release of water under pressure from confined aquifers either at an outcrop of the aquifer or through an opening in the confining bed. The amount of water available in an artesian spring may be large if the catchment area is large. The flow may be slightly increased by the removal of obstructions from the mouth of the spring. (ii) Non-gravity springs include volcanic springs and fissure springs. The volcanic springs are associated with volcanic rocks and the fissure springs result from fractures extending to great depths in the earth’s crust these are usually thermal springs. Thermal springs discharge water having a temperature in excess of the normal local groundwater. These are also designated as warm springs and hot springs. Waters of thermal springs are usually highly mineralized and often contain sulphur. In general springs are capable of supplying small quantity of water and hence these may serve as sources of water supply only for small towns, especially near hills or bases of hills. Further the hot springs cannot be used to supply water for domestic purposes. However, the water obtained from some of the hot springs is found to be useful for the cure of certain skin diseases. (d) Wells A water well is a hole or shaft, usually vertical, excavated in the groundwater to the surface. Water wells may be classified as (i) Open wells or dug wells (ii) Tube wells (i) Open wells or Dug wells: Open wells are the wells which have comparatively large diameters but low yields (or discharge) and are not very deep. The diameters of the open wells usually vary from 1 m to 10 m. The yield of such wells in most of the cases is about 20 m3/hour or less. However, a properly constructed open well penetrating a permeable aquifer can yield 100 to 300 m3/hour. The depths Scope of Civil Engineering 1.15 of open wells may generally range from 2 m to 20 m. Since these wells are usually constructed by digging, these are also known as dug wells. The walls of an open well may be built of brick or stone masonry or precast concrete rings. The thickness generally varies from 0.5 m to 0.75 m depending on the depth of the well. fig 1.8 Cross Section of Open Well Open wells may be further classified as: (a) Shallow open wells (b) Deep open wells Shallow open wells are those which rest in the top water bearing strata and draw their supplies from the surrounding material. On the other hand, deep open wells are those which rest on impervious strata and draw their supplies from the previous formation lying below the impervious strata through bore holes made in the impervious strata. The impervious strata is generally known as mota layer and it is a layer of clay, cemented sand, kankar or other hard materials. The term mota layer is however not applied to layers of hard materials laying above the water table. The main advantage of such a mota layer is that it gives structural support to the open well resting on its surface. Further, since the previous formations below the mota layer generally contain large quantity of water. The yield of deep wells is more than that of shallow wells. It may, however, be mentioned that the nomenclature of shallow and deep open wells is purely technical and it has nothing to do with the actual depth of the well because sometimes a shallow well may have more depth than a deep well. (ii) Tube wells. A tube well is along pipe sunk into the ground intercepting one or more water bearing strata. As compared to open wells, the diameters of tube wells are much less and usually range from 80 mm to 600 mm. The tube wells can also be further classified as: (a) Shallow tube wells (b) Deep tube wells Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.16 fig 1.9 Cross Section of Tube Well Shallow tube wells have their depths limited to about 30 m and may have a maximum yield of about 20 m3/hour. On the other hand, deep tube wells may have maximum depth of about 600 m yield more than 800 m3/hour. The tube wells may also be classified as: (a) Strainer type tube well (b) Cavity type tube well (c) Slotted type tube well Some of the common types of strainers used for the tube wells are as follows: (a) Cook strainer (b) Tej strainer (c) Brownlie strainer (d) Ashford strainer (e) Leggett strainer (f) Phoenix strainer (g) Layne and Bowler strainer",

    "text": "The water required for public water supply schemes should be potable or wholesome water that is fir for drinking purposes. The potable water or wholesome water with relation to various uses of water are discussed below. 1. domestic use The water required for domestic consumption should posses a high degree of purity and it should be free from suspended impurities, bacteria etc. A tolerance of small degree of hardness developed due to certain dissolved salts is however permissible. Thus the drinking water and water used in the food industry and some other industries must meet the highest standard of purity. Following are the requirements of potable or wholesome water for domestic use. 1. It should be clear, odourless and colourless Scope of Civil Engineering 1.17 2. It should be free from harmful and disease producing bacteria 3. It should be free from all objectionable substances 4. It should be fresh and cool 5. It should be palatable that is aesthetically attractive 6. It should be tasty 7. It should not cause corrosion to the pipes and other fittings 2. civic use For this purpose, a large quantity of water is required to fulfill various civic purposes such as washing of roads, cleaning of sewers etc. The nature of use of water is such that any degree of impurity can be tolerated. Hence, the water containing large amount of suspended and dissolved impurities may be permitted for this purpose. But the water considerably mixed up with sewage and other refuse cannot be tolerated for this purpose. 3. Trade or business use The water required for a particular trade will depend upon nature of that trade. For instance, the water required for laundry should not be hard as it well result in more consumption of soap. Similarly the water required for bathing cattles and washing floors in case of stables may contain any type of impurities. 4. commercial or industrial use The water required for this purpose should be chemically pure. The various chemical processes involved in the production make it essential to use chemically pure water. A slight amount of impurity may considerably affect the final results of the product.",

    "text": "various tests. Theses test can be divided into the following three categories. 1. Physical test 2. Chemical test 3. Bacteriological tests 1. physical tests Under this category, the tests are carried out to examine water for the following: (a) Colour (b) Taste and odour (c) Temperature (d) Turbidity Other physical characteristics for which tests are sometimes carried out are density, electrical conductivity, radioactivity and viscosity. (a) Colour The pure waster is colourless and following are the sources which contribute colour to the water. ∑ Algae metabolism ∑ End products of degraded organic matter ∑ Discharge of untreated and partially treated waste water from various industries like food processing, textile industry tanneries, paper production etc. ∑ Divalent species containing iron and manganese etc. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.18 (b) Taste and odour The water possess taste and odour due to various causes and they make the water unpleasant for drinking. The taste and odour of water may also be tested by threshold number. In this method, the water to be tested is diluted with odour-free water and mixture at which odour becomes detectable is determined. It indicates threshold number and other intensities of odour are then worked out. For public water supply, the threshold number not more than 3. (c) Temperature The test for temperature of water has no practical meaning in the sense that it is not possible to give any treatment to control the temperature in any water supply project. The measurement of temperature of water is done with the help of ordinary thermometers. The desirable temperature of potable water is 10°C while temperature of 25°C is considered to be objectionable. (d) Turbidity The colloidal matter present in water interfers with passage of light and thus imparts turbidity to the water. The turbidity is expressed in terms of parts of suspended matter per million parts of water or shortly written as p.p.m. The permissible turbidity for drinking water is 5 to 10 p.p.m. The measurement of turbidity in the field is done by means of a turbidity rod and it is referred to as the visual method of turbidity measurement. For laboratory, the various instruments known as the Jackson turbidimeter, Baylis turbidimeter and Nephelometric turbidimeter. 2. chemical Test Under this category, the tests are carried out to examine water for the following: (a) Chlorides (b) Dissolved gases (c) Hardness (d) Hydrogen-ion Concentration (pH Value) (e) Alkalinity (f) Acidity (g) Metals and other chemical substances (h) Nitrogen and its compounds (i) Total solids (a) Chlorides The chloride contents, especially of sodium chloride or salt, are worked out for a sample of water. The measurement of chloride contents is carried out by the titration method. For potable water, the highest desirable level of chloride content is 250 mg/litre and its maximum permissible level is 600 mg/litre. (b) Dissolved gas The water contains various gases from its contact with the atmosphere and ground surfaces. The usual gases are nitrogen, methane, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide and oxygen. The contents of these dissolved gases in a sample of water are suitably worked out. The quantity of oxygen for potable water should be 5 to 10 ppm. (c) Hardness The term hardness is defined as the ability of the water to cause precipitation of insoluble calcium and magnesium slats of higher fatty acids from soap. The hardness Scope of Civil Engineering 1.19 is usually measured by the soap solution test. For potable water, the hardness should preferably be more than 5 degrees but less than 8 degrees or so. (d) Hydrogen–ion Concentration (pH Value) The acidity or alkalinity of water is measured in terms of pH value or H-ion concentration. Two methods are employed to measure the pH value of water. One is electrometric method and colourimetric method. It is desirable to maintain pH value of water very close to 7. (e) Alkalinity The term alkalinity with reference to the water and waste water is defined as the capacity of substances contained in the water to take up hydronium to reach a defined pH value 4.3 to 14. The alkalinity of a sample can be determined by the process of titration. (f) Acidity The term acidity with reference to the water and waste water is defined as the capacity of substances contained in the water to take up hydroxyl ions to reach a defined pH value 0 to 8.2. (g) Metals and other chemical substances The various tests are made to detect the presence of different metals and other chemical substances in a sample of water. Table gives the maximum concentration of metals and other chemical substances in potable water as recommended by U.S Public Health Service standards. concentration of metals and other chemical Substances in potable water S.

For potable water the highest desirable level of nitrates is 45 mg per litre. (i) Total solids: The term solid with reference to the environmental engineering is defined as the residue in water left after evaporation and drying in oven at 103° C to 105°C. The total solids consist dissolved and suspended matter. The permissible total dissolved solids for drinking water to BIS is 500 mg/l with tolerable limit as 1500 mg/l. 3. Bacteriological Tests The examination of water for the presence of bacteria is very important. The bacteria are very small organisms and it is not possible to detect them by microscopes. Hence they are detected by circumstantial evidences or chemical reactions. Two standard Bacteriological Tests for the bacteriological examinations of water. (a) Total count or Agar plate count test (b) B-coli test (a) Total count or Agar plate count test: In this test, the bacteria are cultivated on specially prepared medium of agar for different dilutions of sample of water with sterilized water. The diluted sample is placed in an incubator for 24 hours at 37 C or for 48 hours at 20 C. These represent the so-called hot counts and cold counts respectively. The bacterial colonies which are formed, are then counted and the results are computed for 1 cc. For potable water, the total count should not exceed 100 per c.c. (b) B-coli test: This test is divided into the following three parts ∑ Presumptive test ∑ Confirmed test ∑ Completed test The presumptive test is based on the ability of coliform group to ferment the lactose broth and producing gas. The confirmed test consists of growing cultures of coliform bacteria on media which suppress the growth of other organisms. The completed test is based on the ability of the culture grown in the confirmed test to again the lactose broth. B-coli index: This is an index or number which represents approximately the number of B-coli per c.c of sample of water under consideration. For potable water, Scope of Civil Engineering 1.21 the b-coli index should be preferably less than 3 and it should not exceed 10 in any event.

    "text": "water has become centralized. Living creatures of the universe are made of five basic elements, viz., Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Sky. Obviously, water is one of the main resource, without which, it is not possible for us to sustain our lives. A country’s level of water use is one of the key measure of its level of economic development. Developing countries like India uses 90 percent of its water for agricultural purpose, just 7 percent for industry and hardly 3 percent for domestic use. Despite having a great regard for water, we seem to have failed to address this sector seriously. Human being could not save and conserve water and it sources, probably because of its availability in abundance. But this irresponsible attitude resulted in deterioration of water bodies with respect to quantity and quality both. Now, situation has arrived when even a single drop of water matters. However, “better late than never”, we have not realized the seriousness of this issue and initiated efforts to overcome these problems. System of collection of rainwater and conserving for future needs has traditionally been practiced in India. The Government of Tamil Nadu passed a Government Order (GO) to implement the Rainwater harvesting as compulsory in the state. This scheme was highly appreciated by the Government of India in the parliament house. Now-a-days, many states are following this scheme and ultimately they found the benefits. The term rainwater harvesting is being frequently used these days; however, the concept of water harvesting is not new for India. Water harvesting techniques had been evolved and developed centuries ago. Groundwater resource gets naturally recharged through percolation. But due to indiscriminate development and rapid urbanization, exposed surface for soil has been reduced drastically with resultant reduction in percolation of rainwater, thereby depleting groundwater resource. Rainwater harvesting is the process of augmenting the natural filtration of rainwater into the underground formation by some artificial methods. “Conscious collection and storage of rainwater to cater to the demands of water, for drinking, domestic purpose and irrigation is termed as Rainwater Harvesting.” I. Objectives of Rainwater Harvesting To provide water for domestic purposes • To increase water resource • To reduce water scarcity • To arrest groundwater decline and augment groundwater table • To beneficiate water quality in aquifers • To conserve surface water runoff during monsoon • To reduce soil erosion and run-off losses • To inculcate a culture of water conservation • II. Methods of Rainwater Harvesting Rainwater can be harvested by any one of the following methods after analyzing the soil characteristics, topography, rainfall pattern and the climatic conditions. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.23 By storing in vessels, tanks and reservoirs above or below the ground • By constructing pits, lagoons, dug wells or check dams, etc. • By recharging the groundwater. • Broadly, there are two ways of harvesting Rainwater: (i) Surface runoff harvesting (ii) Rooftop rainwater harvesting (i) Surface runoff harvesting In urban areas, rainwater flows away as surface runoff. This runoff could be caught and used for recharging aquifers by adopting appropriate methods. (ii) Rooftop rainwater harvesting (RTRWH) It is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the catchments and the rainwater is collected from the roof of the house/building. It can either be stored in a tank or diverted to artificial recharge system. This method is less expensive and very effective and if implemented properly, helps in augmenting the groundwater level of the area.  Rooftop rainwater harvesting III. Components of the Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting System The system mainly constitutes of the following sub components: (i) Catchment The surface that receives rainfall directly is the catchment of rainwater harvesting system. It may be terrace, courtyard, or paved or unpaved open ground. The terrace may be flat RCC/stone roof or sloping roof. Therefore, the catchment is the area, which actually contributes rainwater to the harvesting system. (ii) Transportation Rainwater from rooftop should be carried through down take water pipes or drains to storage/harvesting system. Water pipes should be UV resistant (ISI Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.24 HDPE/PVC - High-density polyethylene, Polyvinyl chloride - pipes) of required capacity. Water from sloping roofs could be caught through gutters and down take pipe. At terraces, mouth of the each drain should have wire mesh to restrict floating material. (iii) First Flush First flush is a device used to flush off the water received in first shower. The first shower of rains needs to be flushed-off to avoid contaminating storable/ rechargeable water by the probable contaminants of the atmosphere and the catchment roof. It will also help in cleaning of silt and other material deposited on roof during dry seasons. Provisions of first rain separator should be made at outlet of each drain pipe. (iv) Filter There is always some skepticism regarding roof top rainwater harvesting, since doubts are raised that rainwater may contaminate groundwater. There is remote possibility of this fear coming true if proper filter mechanism is not adopted. Secondly, all care must be taken to see that underground sewer drains are not punctured and no leakage is taking place in close vicinity. Filters are used for treatment of water to effectively remove turbidity, colour and microorganisms. After first flushing of rainfall, water should pass through filters. There are different types of filters in practice, but basic function is to purify water. IV. Methods of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting (i) Storage of Direct Use In this method, rainwater collected from the roof of the building is diverted to a storage tank. The storage tank has to be designed according to the water requirements, rainfall and catchment availability. Each drain pipe should have mesh filter at mouth and first flush device followed by filtration system before connecting to the storage tank. It is advisable that each tank should have excess water overflow system. Excess water could be diverted to recharge system. Water from storage tank can be used for secondary purposes such as washing and gardening, etc. This is the most cost effective way of rainwater harvesting. The main advantage of collecting and using the rainwater during rainy season is not only to save water from conventional sources, but also to save energy incurred on transportation and distribution of water at the doorstep. This also conserve groundwater, if it is being extracted to meet the demand when rains are on. (ii) Recharging Groundwater Aquifers Groundwater aquifers can be recharged by various kinds of structures to ensure percolation of rainwater in the ground instead of draining away from the surface. Commonly used recharging methods are: (a) recharging of bore wells Rainwater collected from rooftop of the building is diverted through drainpipes to settlement or filtration tank. After settlement, filtered water is diverted to bore wells to recharge deep aquifers. Abandoned bore wells can also be used for recharge. Optimum capacity of settlement tank/filtration tank can be designed on the basis of area of catchment, intensity of rainfall and recharge rate. While recharging, entry of floating matter and silt should be restricted because it may clog the recharge structure. First one or Scope of Civil Engineering 1.25 two showers should be flushed out through rain separator to avoid contamination. This is very important, and all care should be taken to ensure that this has been done. (b) recharge pits Recharge pits are small pits of any shape rectangular, square or circular, constructed with brick or stone masonry wall with deep hole at regular intervals. The top of pit can be covered with perforated covers. Bottom of pit should be filled with filter media. The capacity of the pit can be designed on the basis of catchment area, rainfall intensity and recharge rate of soil. Usually, the dimensions of the pit may be of 1 m to 2 m wide and 2 to 3 m deep depending on the depth of pervious strata. These pits are suitable for recharging of shallow aquifers and small houses. (c) Soak away or recharge shafts Soak away or recharge shafts are provided where upper layer of soil is alluvial or less pervious. These are bored hole of 30 cm diameter up to 10 m to 15 m deep, depending on depth of pervious layer. Bore should be lined with slotted/ perforated PVC/MS pipe to prevent collapse of the vertical sides. At the top of soak away, required size sump is constructed to retain runoff before the filters through soak away. Sump should be filled with filter media. (d) recharging of dug wells Dug well can be used as recharge structure. Rainwater from the rooftop is diverted to dug wells after passing it through filtration bed. Cleaning and desalting of dug well should be done regularly to enhance the recharge rate. The filtration method suggested for bore well recharging could be used. (e) recharge Trenches Recharge trench is provided where upper impervious layer of soil is shallow. It is a trench excavated on the ground and refilled with porous media like pebbles, boulder or brickbats. It is usually made for harvesting the surface runoff. Bore wells can also be provided inside the trench as recharge shafts to enhance percolation. The length of the trench is decided as per the amount of runoff expected. This method is suitable for small houses, playgrounds, parks and roadside drains. The recharge trench can be of size 0.50 to 1.0 m wide and 1.0 to 1.5 m deep. (f) percolation Tanks Percolation tanks are artificially created surface water bodies, submerging a land area with adequate permeability to facilitate sufficient percolation to recharge the groundwater. These can be built in big campuses where land is available and topography is suitable. Surface run-off and rooftop water can be diverted to this tank. Water accumulating in the tank percolates in the solid to augment the groundwater. The stored water can be used directly for gardening and raw use. Percolation tanks should be built in gardens, open spaces and roadside green belts of urban area. V. Benefits of Rainwater Harvesting Improves the quality of groundwater • Rises the water levels in wells for future use • Improves soil moisture • Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.26 Low cost expenses with little maintenance • Helps in recharging the aquifers • Reduces water scarcity •",

    "text": "Environmental engineering deals with pollution control and public health engineering. Different types of pollutions are water, air, noise and others. Due to large scale industrialization, population growth, rapid urbanization and several other human activities like construction, mining, transportation, etc., environment gets polluted. Environmental engineering deals with technologies and facilities which are engaged in reducing pollution. It includes design, construction and maintenance of water treatment plant, waste water treatment plant, water distribution network and sewerage system; it also deals with solid waste management in towns and cities. Public health engineering includes water treatment, water distribution network and solid waste management. Environmental engineering is concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human population from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments, both local and global, from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and improvement of environmental quality. Environmental engineering can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation, protection of assets and control of waste from human and animal activities. Furthermore, it is concerned with finding possible solutions in the field of public health, such as waterborne diseases, implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. It involves waste water management, air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, radiation protection, industrial hygiene, animal agriculture, environmental sustainability, health and environmental engineering law. It also includes studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction projects. Environmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the environment. To do so, they conduct studies on hazardous-waste management to evaluate the significance of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. Environmental engineers design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems. They address local and worldwide environmental issues such as the effects of acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources. Apart from tackling solid and waste water disposal, civil engineers have to tackle air pollution problem also. Due to industrialization air pollution is becoming a major problem. It is estimated that for every tonne of cement produced, one tonne of CO2 is released in the environment. Vehicles also produce lot of CO2. During the last one century, the environmental pollution has resulted in global warming by 4°C. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.27 An environmental disaster will be unavoidable if China, India and other developing countries start consuming as much energy and materials as the West did it in its march to industrialization.

    "text": "Transportation means movement of passengers and goods by means of vehicles on land, ship on water and aircrafts in air. Transportation engineering is that branch of civil engineering which deals with planning, designing and construction of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, harbors, ports, docks, runways, and airports. As for the development of any nation, good transportation network is of prime importance. Transportation engineering is the application of technology and scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods. It is a sub- discipline of civil engineering. Providing good and economical road links is an important duty of civil engineers. It involves design and construction of base courses, suitable surface finishes, cross drainage works, intersections, culverts, bridges and tunnels, etc. Railways is another important long-way transport facility. Design, construction and maintenance of railway lines are parts of transportation engineering. Globalization has resulted into requirement of airports and harbors. For proper planning of these transport facilities, traffic survey is to be carried out. Carrying out traffic survey and then planning, designing, construction and maintenance of roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, airports and harbours is known as transportation engineering. The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of urban planning, and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors. Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of trip generation (how many trips for what purpose), trip distribution (destination choice, where is the traveler going), mode choice (what mode is being taken), and route assignment (which streets or routes are being used). More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as land use forecasting). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system. The design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility has), determining the materials and thickness used in pavement, designing the geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track). Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.28 Roads are the key to the development of an economy. A good road network constitutes the basic infrastructure that accelerates the development process through connectivity and opening up of the backward regions to trade and investment. Roads also play a key role in inter-modal transport development establishing links with airports, railway stations and ports. In addition, they have an important role in promoting national integration, which is particularly important in a large country like India. Since independence, there has been a tremendous increase in the volume of road traffic, both passenger and freight. Of all the modes of transport, road transport is nearest and at the easiest approach of people. The goods and people have to be first moved by road before reaching other modes of transport. I. Advantages of Road Transport Less capital outlay • Door to door service • Service in rural areas • Flexible service • Suitable for short distance • Lesser risk of damage in transit • Saving in packing cost • Rapid speed • Less cost • II. Disadvantages of Road Transport Seasonal nature • Accidents and breakdowns • Unsuitable for long distance and bulky traffic • Slow speed • Lack of organization • III. Advantages of Railway Transport Dependable • Better organised • High speed over long distances • Suitable for bulky and heavy goods • Cheaper transport • Safety • Larger capacity • Public welfare • Administrative facilities of government • Employment opportunities • Scope of Civil Engineering 1.29 IV. Disadvantages of Railway Transport 1. Huge capital outlay 2. Lack of flexibility 3. Lack of door to door service 4. Monopoly 5. Unsuitable for short distance and small loads 6. Booking formalities 7.

    "text": "Road network provides the arterial network to facilitate trade, transport, social integration and economic development. It facilitates specialization, extension of markets and exploitation of economies of scale. It is used for the smooth conveyance of both people and goods. Transportation by road has the advantage over other means of transport because of its easy accessibility, flexibility of operations, door-to-door service and reliability. Consequently, passenger and freight movement in India over the years have increasingly shifted towards roads vis-à-vis other means of transport. fig 1.11 Cross section of Highway The history of highway engineering gives us an idea about the roads of ancient times. Roads in Rome were constructed on a large scale and radiated in many directions helping them in military operations. Thus, they are considered to be pioneers in road construction. 1. roman roads The earliest large scale road construction is attributed to Romans who constructed an extensive system of roads radiating in many directions from Rome. Romans recognized that the fundamentals of good road construction were to provide Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.30 good drainage, good material and good workmanship. Their roads were very durable, and some still exist. The roads were bordered on both sides by longitudinal drains. 2. British road The British government also gave importance to road construction. The British engineer John Macadam introduced what can be considered as the first scientific road construction method. Stone size was an important element of Macadam recipe. By empirical observation of many roads, he came to realize that 250 mm layers of well compacted broken angular stone would provide the same strength and a better running surface than an expensive pavement founded on large stone blocks. Thus, he introduced an economical method of road construction. Use of bituminous concrete and cement concrete is the most important development. Development of new equipment helps in the faster construction of roads. Many easily and locally available materials are tested in the laboratories and then implemented on roads for making economical and durable pavements. 3. classification of highways The roads can be classified in many ways. The classification based on speed and accessibility is the most generic one. Note that as the accessibility of road increases, the speed reduces. Accordingly, the roads can be classified as follows in the order of increased accessibility and reduced speeds. Freeways: Freeways are access controlled divided highways. Most freeways are • four lanes, two lanes each direction, but many freeways widen to incorporate more lanes as they enter urban areas. Access is controlled through the use of interchanges, and the type of interchange depends upon the kind of intersecting roadway. Expressways: They are superior type of highways and are designed for high speeds • (120 km/h is common), high traffic volume and safety. They are generally provided with grade separations at intersections. Parking, loading and unloading of goods and pedestrian traffic is not allowed on expressways. Highways: They represent the superior type of roads in a country. Highways are of • two types: rural highways and urban highways. Rural highways are those passing through rural areas (villages) and urban highways are those passing through large cities and towns, i.e. urban areas. Based on Usage This classification is based on whether the roads can be used during different seasons of the year. All-weather roads are those roads which are negotiable during all weathers, except at major river crossings where interruption of traffic is permissible up to a certain extent. Fair-weather roads are negotiable only during fair weather. Based on Carriage Way This classification is based on the type of the carriage way or the road pavement. Paved roads with hard surface are provided with a hard pavement course (for example, stones, Water bound macadam (WBM), Bituminous macadam (BM), concrete roads). Unpaved roads are not provided with a hard course of at least a WBM layer. Thus, earth and gravel roads come under this category. Based on Pavement Surface Based on the type of pavement surfacing provided, roads are classified as surfaced and unsurfaced roads. Surfaced roads (BM, concrete) are provided Scope of Civil Engineering 1.31 with a bituminous or cement concreting surface. Unsurfaced roads (soil/gravel) are not provided with a bituminous or cement concreting surface. Other Criteria Roads may also be classified based on the traffic volume in that road, load transported through that road, or location and function of that road. Based on traffic volume, they are classified as heavy, medium and light traffic roads. Based on the load carried by these roads, they can be classified as class I, class II, etc. or class A, class B, etc. and the limits may be expressed as tones per day. The classification based on location and function should be a more acceptable classification since they may be defined clearly.",

    "text": "1. Introduction In 1832, the first railway running on steam engine was launched in England. Thereafter, on 1st of August 1849, the Great Indian Peninsular Railways Company was established in India. On 17th of August 1849, a contract was signed between the Great Indian Peninsular Railways Company and East India Company. As a result of the contract, an experiment was made by laying a railway track between Bombay and Thane (56 km). On 16th April 1853, the first train service was started from Bombay to Thane. On 15th August 1854, the second train service commenced between Howrah and Hubli. On the 1st July, 1856, the third train service in India and first in South India commenced between Vyasarpadi and Walajah Road and on the same day, the section between Vyasarpadi and Royapuram by Madras Railway Company was also opened. Subsequently, construction of this efficient transport system began simultaneously in different parts of the country. By the end of 19th century, 24752 km of rail track was laid for traffic. At this juncture the power, capital and revenue rested with the British. Revenue started flowing through passenger as well as through goods traffic.  Cross section of Railway Track 2. gauge The clear minimum horizontal distance between the inner (running) faces of the two rails forming a track is known as gauge. Indian railway followed this practice. In European countries, the gauge is measured between the inner faces of two rails at a point 14 mm below the top of the rail. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.32 Different gauges in Indian Railways are as follows: 1. Broad gauge (BG) 1676 mm 2. Metre gauge (MG) 1000 mm 3. Narrow gauge (NG) 762 mm Broad Gauge: When the clear horizontal distance between the inner faces of two • parallel rails forming a track is 1676 mm, the gauge is called broad gauge (BG). Metre Gauge: When the clear horizontal distance between the inner faces of two • parallel rails forming a track is 1000 mm, the gauge is known as metre gauge (MG). Narrow Gauge: When the clear horizontal distance between the inner faces of two • parallel rails forming a track is either 762 mm or 610 mm, the gauge is known as narrow gauge (NG). 3. rails Rails are the members of the track laid in two parallel lines to provide an unchanging, continuous, and level surface for the movement of trains. To be able to withstand stresses, they are made of high-carbon steel. 4. Sleepers Sleepers are the transverse ties that are laid to support the rails. They have an important role in the track as they transmit the wheel load from the rails to the ballast. Several types of sleepers are used in Indian Railways. 5. Ballast Ballast is a layer of broken stones, gravel, moorum, or any other granular material placed and packed below and around sleepers for distributing load from the sleepers to the formation. It provides drainage as well as longitudinal and lateral stability to the track. 6. Requirement of an Ideal Permanent Railway Track The following are the principal requirements of an ideal permanent way or of a good railway track: The gauge of the permanent way should be uniform, correct and should not get • altered. Both the rails should be at the same level on tangent (straight) portion of the • track. Proper amount of superelevation should be provided to the outer rail above the • inner rail on curved portion of the track. The permanent way should be sufficiently strong against lateral forces. • The curves provided in the track should be properly designed. • An even and uniform gradient should be provided throughout the length of the • track. The tractive resistance of the track should be minimum. • The design of the permanent way should be such that the load of the train is • uniformly distributed on both the rails so as to prevent unequal settlement of the track. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.33 It should provide adequate elasticity in order to prevent the harshness of impacts • between the rails and the moving wheel loads of a train. It should be free from excessive rail joints and all the joining should be properly • designed and constructed. All the component parts such as rails, sleepers, ballast, fixtures and fastenings, etc. • should satisfy the design requirements. All the fixtures and fastenings such as chairs, bearing plates, fish plates, fish bolts, • spikes, etc. should be strong enough to withstand the stresses occurring in the track. All the points and crossings laid in the permanent way should be properly designed • and carefully constructed. It should be provided with fence near level crossings and also in urban areas. • It should be provided with proper drainage facilities so as to drain off the Rainwater • quickly away from the track. It should be provided with safe and strong bridges coming in the alignment of the • track. It should be so constructed that repairs and renewals of any of its portion can be • carried out without any difficulty.",

It is necessary to select the right material that can give the desired quality at the minimum cost. The selection of pattern materials depends on the following: 1. The number of casting to be manufactured. 2. The desired level of dimensional accuracy and surface finish required. 3. The shape and size of the casting. 4. The design and fine details of the casting. 5. The type of moulding processes. 6. The method of moulding, i.e., sand moulding or machine moulding. Patterns may be made by using materials such as wood, metals, plastics, plaster and wax. 1. Wood Wood is the material most commonly used for making patterns for sand moulding, Wood can be easily shaped or worked with to get patterns of desired shape and size. It is light in weight, abundantly available, cheap and can be handled easily. However, wood is easily affected by moisture, and it possesses less strength. Hence, it is not suitable for mass production. The most common types of wood used are mahogany, teak and pine. 2. Metals and Alloys Metal patterns are mostly cast from wooden patterns or machined to desired shape. Metal patterns are stronger, accurate and durable. The other advantages are its ability to withstand rough handling, high resistance to warp, wear and abrasion. However, metal patterns are expensive and not easily repaired. Ferrous metals get rusted. Metals are heavier and difficult to handle. Metals cannot be machined easily. Metal patterns are used when the number of castings to be manufactured is large. Aluminium and its alloys, steel, cast iron, brass and white metal are the different metals used for making patterns. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.41 3. Plastics Plastic patterns are prepared with the help of wooden patterns. Plastics are light. These are moisture resistant and provide a smooth surface. These are also wear and corrosion resistant. Plastic patterns are durable and do not involve any appreciable change in size or shape. However, plastic patterns are weak and need metal reinforcement for light sections. Plastic patterns are also not suited for machine moulding. Both the thermosetting and the thermoplastic materials are used for making patterns. Common plastic materials used for making patterns are epoxy resin, polyester resins and polystyrene. 4. Plaster Plaster pattern is also made with the help of wooden patterns. Plaster pattern can be easily worked by using wood working tools. Intricate shapes can be made easily. Plaster has a high compressive strength. Hence, the plaster pattern is used for making small and intricate castings and core boxes. Materials such as plaster of Paris or gypsum cement are commonly used for plaster patterns. 5. Wax The wax pattern is made in a water cooled metal mould or a die. The wax pattern provides a very good surface finish and high accuracy. For removing the wax pattern, the mould with the pattern is inverted and heated to make the wax melt away. The wax pattern is used in investment casting or lost wax process.",

    "text": "In the metal casting process, the pattern is used to manufacture a casting of the desired dimensions, but the pattern is not made dimensionally identical with the casting. The various reasons are the following: 1. All metals shrink in size when there is a change from the liquid to the solid state. 2. Castings require surface finishings. 3. The pattern should be removed from the mould cavity without tearing the mould cavity surface. 4. Casting tends to warp or distort during the cooling stage. Therefore, the patterns are made with certain allowances on size. The various patterns allowances include the following: 1. Shrinkage allowance. 2. Finishing allowance or machining allowance. 3. Draft allowance or taper allowance. 4. Distortion allowance or camber allowance. 5. Shaking allowance or rapping allowance. For quality castings, there should be a balance between all these allowances. 1. Shrinkage Allowance Shrinkage allowance is the allowance given on the pattern size for avoiding any change in the dimensions of the casting because of the shrinkage of the metal during solidification. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.42 Different metals shrink differently and have different shrinkage allowances. Shrinkage allowances for important casting metals are given below: Grey cast iron 7-10.5 mm/m Steel 20 mm/m Aluminium 18 mm/m Shrinkage allowances are given by using a shrink rule which includes the proportionate allowances on every measurement. Shrink rules are available for every casting metal. The shrinkage allowance to be given depends on the following major factors: 1. The type of metal being used 2. The size and shape of the casting and 3. The moulding medium. 2. Finishing Allowance or Machining Allowance The finishing or machining allowance is the allowance given on size of the pattern for finishing or machining the rough surface of the casting. The standard finishing allowance for ferrous metal is 3 mm and that for nonferrous metals is 1.5 mm. The finishing or machining allowance to be given depends on the following major factors: 1. The type of metal being used. 2. The casting design. 3. The method of casting. 4. The method of cleaning and 5. The degree of finish required for the casting. 3. Draft Allowance or Taper Allowance Draft allowance is the taper allowed on vertical faces of a pattern for easy removal of the pattern without damaging the mould cavity surface as given in Figs. 1.13(a) and 1.13(b). A draft of 3-6 mm per metre is generally adopted. For patterns used in machine moulding, normally one degree taper is given. This allowance depends on the following factors: (1) The size and shape of the casting. (2) The length of the vertical face of the casting. (3) The method of moulding and (4) The intricacy or fine details of the casting. (a) Pattern having no Draft Allowance (b) Pattern having Draft Allowance 4. Distortion or Camber Allowance Due to the internal stresses developed during cooling, the casting may be distorted. For example, if the casting has a U-shape, it will tend to cool faster at the ends, giving rise to internal stresses in the bent portion. As a result, on cooling, the legs of the casting would deflect outwards as shown below in Figs. 1.14(a) and 1.14(b). Scope of Civil Engineering 1.43 Distortion allowance is given to avoid this by intentionally deflecting the leg inwards. This allowance depends on the following factors: 1. The type of metal being used; 2. The design of the casting; and 3. The length of thin section in casting. (i) (ii) (iii) (a) U-shaped Casting (b) l-section Casting (i) Required shape of casting (ii) Casting produced with distortion (iii) Pattern provided with Camber allowance (i) Required shape of casting (ii) Casting casting (iii) Cambered pattern (i) (ii) (iii)  Distortion or Camber Allowance Distortion allowance is given based on previous experience or the distortion produced in a casting made with a pattern without any distortion allowance is measured and then the allowance is provided on the pattern. 5. Shake Allowance or Rapping Allowance For the easy withdrawal of the pattern from the moulding sand, the pattern is slightly rapped or shaked around the vertical faces which leads to a slight enlargement in the mould cavity. So, the final casting will be slightly over sized. The shake allowance is given to overcome this problem, by making the pattern slightly smaller in size.",

    "text": "In the metal casting process, various types of patterns can be used; but it is necessary to select a particular type of pattern for our application. The various factors to be considered to the selection of a pattern type are the following: 1. Shape and size of the casting 2. Number of casting Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.44 3. Method of moulding adopted 4. Complexity and intricacy of the casting 5. Accuracy required; and 6. Problems associated with the moulding operation such as the removal of patterns from the mould. The various types of patterns commonly used are explained in the following sections; 1. SolidPattern or Single Piece Pattern The simplest form of pattern made without any joints, partings or loose pieces in its construction is called a solid or single piece pattern as shown in . It is inexpensive and generally used for large castings of simple shape. 2. Split Pattern All patterns cannot be made in a single piece because of the difficulties faced in removing them from the mould. To overcome this problem, some patterns are made in two parts so that half of the pattern will rest in the lower part of the mould and the other half in the upper part. The two parts are aligned by means of dowel pins as shown in . Some complicated casting requires three or more parts to be constructed and such a pattern is called a multi-piece pattern. 3. Match Plate Pattern In match plate patterns, each half of the patterns are mounted on opposite sides of a plate called a match plate. This is widely used in machine moulding. The gates and runners are also attached to the plate. The match plate pattern is aligned by means of locator holes in the match plate and locating pins on the moulding box as shown in . 4. Loose Piece Pattern It is a pattern with loose pieces which are necessary to facilitate the withdrawal of the pattern from the mould as in . Loose pieces are removed separately by turning or moving through the cavity formed after the main pattern has been removed. These loose pieces are fastened loosely to the main part by means of wooden dowel pins. 5. Skeleton Pattern Skeleton pattern is used for making a few large castings. The skeleton pattern has a wooden framework filled with loam sand. This is to save the amount of pattern materials used. The final shape is given with a strickle. It is shown schematically . (a) Single Piece Pattern Dowel pin (b) Split Pattern Match plate Hole for locating Patterns Runner (c) Match plate pattern (d) Loose Piece pattern Scope of Civil Engineering 1.45 Strickle Loam sand End support (e) Skeleton Pattern 6. Follow Board Pattern Follow board pattern is used for casting which has some structurally weak portions which need some support for avoiding breakage during the moulding process. Hence, these weak portions are supported by means of a board that will closely fit the contour of the weak pattern. This arrangement is shown in . 7. Sweep Pattern Sweep patterns are used to manufacture large casting of symmetrical shape and with a circular cross-section. A sweep pattern consists of a wooden board with outer contour similar to the casting’s form. This board is fixed to a metal rod and rotated about the metal rod as the axis of rotation, for getting a complete mould cavity. This arrangement is shown in . This pattern is economical, since only a wooden board is used instead of large-size expensive solid pattern. Post Sweep Green sand (g) Sweep pattern Pattern Follow board (f) Follow board pattern Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.46 8. Gated Pattern When large number of small castings are required, gated patterns are used. Such patterns are usually made of metal to give them strength. The gates and runners for the molten metal are formed by the connecting parts between individual patterns as shown in . Gate Patterns Runner (h) Gated pattern 9. Shell Pattern Shell patterns are widely used for large symmetrical casting such as drainage fittings and pipes. The shell pattern consists of a hollow construction. The outside contour is used as a pattern to form the mould. The shell pattern is made of two halves, which are correctly aligned together by means of dowel pins. The shell pattern is usually made of metals and shown in . (i) Shell pattern 10. Cope and Drag Pattern The cope and drag pattern is used for very large castings, in case the complete mould is too heavy and difficult to handle by a single operator. The cope and drag pattern is made in two halves. Both are moulded separately and are then assembled to make the complete mould.",

    "text": "The principal properties of the moulding sand are the following: Refractoriness It is the ability of the moulding sand to withstand the high temperature of the molten metal so that it does not cause fusion. Strength The moulding sand should have sufficient strength (green strength, dry strength and hot strength) to retain the mould shape under green (5 to 8% water content), dry and hot conditions respectively. Flowability Flowability is the ability of the moulding sand to get compacted to take up the required shape. Flowability increases as clay and water contents increase. Porosity or Permeability The moulding sand should be porous enough to allow the gases picked up by the molten metal while transferring or gases generated in the mould to escape from the mould. This capability of the moulding sand is known as permeability. Strength or Cohesiveness It is the ability of the moulding sand grains to adhere to each other. It is necessary for a uniform packing of the moulding sand while preparing a mould. Adhesiveness Adhesiveness is the property of moulding sand to adhere to the walls of moulding boxes. It is necessary to enable the safe handling of the mould from one place to another. Collapsibility Collapsibility is the readiness of the moulding sand to get collapsed, after the solidification of the casting. Durability It is the ability of the moulding sand to withstand the heating and cooling during repeated usage. Chemical Resistivity It is the ability of the moulding sand to resist any chemical reaction with the molten metal. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.48",

    "text": "The principal ingredients of moulding sand are the following: Refractory Sand Grains This is a mixture of silica sand SiO2(80-90%), alumina and magnesium oxide. Refractory sand grains give the refractoriness, chemical resistivity and permeability of the moulding sand. Binders Binder provides the necessary bonding strength to the moulding sand and it holds the sand together. Clay is most commonly used binder along with the moulding sand. Kaolinite or fire clay and bentonite are the most commonly used binders. Water Water is added to activate the clay in the moulding sand. The addition of water develops the necessary plasticity. The amount of water should be kept within certain range as excess water decreases the strength and the formability of the moulding sand. Normally, the water content is in the range of 2-8 per cent. Additives In addition to these basic ingredients, any other materials added to get some specific properties in the moulding sand are called additives. These are mixed with the moulding sand during sand preparation. Some common additives and their purposes are given below: Coal dust—for protecting the mould surface against the action of molten metal and to get a good surface finish. Dextrin—for increasing the toughness and collapsibility. Iron oxide powder—for getting high temperature plasticity, hot strength and anti-metal penetration properties for the moulding sand.

The drag portion of the moulding box is kept upside down on the bottom board. The drag portion of the pattern is placed at the centre of the moulding box on the moulding board with sufficient clearance between the pattern and the moulding box walls as shown in . Dry facing sand is sprinkled all around the patterns to avoid the sticking of pattern with the moulding sand. Then, sufficient amount of moulding sand is put into the Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.50 moulding box and on the drag pattern so as to fill the box completely. The moulding sand is added if necessary. The excess sand is subsequently removed by striking off with a bar and the moulding sand in the box is levelled. Parting sand is then sprinkled over the top of the moulding box. Vent holes are made in the drag portion for the removal of gases during solidification of the casting. This is done by using a vent wire. Now the moulding box is turned over and is kept in an upright position. This is explained in .

The sprue hole is the passage through which the molten metal from the funnel shaped cavity at the top of the mould reaches the mould cavity. Then a riser pin is kept at an appropriate place for making the riser. The riser is a reservoir of molten metal provided in the mould and it is also used as a vent. These arrangements are shown in . Then a sufficient amount of moulding sand is added and the entire procedure adopted for preparing the drag half of the mould is repeated. Then the sprue pin and the riser pin are carefully withdrawn. A funnel-shaped cavity is formed near the top of the sprue hole. This is called the pouring basin. The cope is separated from the drag and the loose sands on cope and drag interface are removed. Then, the pattern halves are withdrawn carefully by using drawspikes and by rapping the pattern. The runners and the gates are cut in the mould cavity carefully without spoiling the mould cavity using the gate cutters. The loose sands are removed by blowing away with bellows.

The huge or mass production of castings is done by using machine moulding which uses techniques like squeezing, jolting, vibrating, slinging, blowing or any combined methods for compacting the moulding sand around the pattern. Various machines used to prepare the moulds are namely. 1. Squeezers 2. Jolt Machines 3. Jolt and Squeeze Machines Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.52 4. Slingers The principles of operation of each moulding machine are explained below: 1. Squeezers Squeeze moulding machines utilize pressure for compacting the moulding sand. The pressure may be applied through a squeezer head. This type of moulding machine is available with tight moulding chambers. These machines normally utilize gravity to fill the moulding chamber. Then the squeeze pressure is applied by air cylinders as shown in . Squeeze head Match plate pattern Down sprue Compressed air Blow slots Squeeze head  Squeeze moulding machine 2. Jolt Machines The jolt type machines operate with the pattern mounted on a pattern plate, which in turn is fastened to the machine table. A flask is placed on the pattern and positively located by pins relative to the pattern. The flask is filled with sand and the machine starts the jolt operation. This is accomplished by alternately applying and releasing air pressure to the jolt piston which causes the flask, sand and pattern to lift for few centimeters and then fall to a stop, producing a sharp jolt. This process is repeated for a predetermined number of times and due to the kinetic energy of the sand, the moulding sand will be compacted. When the process is completed, the push off pins at the bottom edge of the flask lift the flask. The operation of the jolt machine is shown in .

    "text": "The various steps in the operation of a cupola furnace are the following: 1. Preparation of Cupola The preparation of a cupola furnace begins after dropping the bottom at the completion of the previous melting. In this step, the remaining materials (coke, slag, and metal) in the cupola in the previous melting are removed. Slag, coke and the metal pieces adhering to the side linings are chipped off. Heat resistant linings are repaired with new fire bricks and clay. Then the bottom door is closed and duly supported with the metal prop. A sloping sand bed is prepared with tempered sand over the bottom door. The slope gives a better metal flow. The sand bed is prepared by uniform ramming to avoid any leakage of molten metal. 2. Starting of Ignition For starting the cupola, soft and dry pieces of woods are spread over the sand bed. A coke bed is prepared over the wooden pieces. The wooden pieces are ignited either through the tap hole or through some other opening. The height of coke bed is maintained in the order of about 75 cm above the tuyers by adding an additional amount of coke as the initial coke bed burns well. The ignition is started about three hours before the molten metal is needed for pouring into the moulds. 3. Charging After the coke bed is properly ignited, the charging is done. The charging of cupola is adding alternate layers of lime stone (flux), iron and coke upto the level of the charging floor. The flux is a substance added for slag formation and for easy removal of impurities. It also reduces the oxidation of iron and lowers the melting point of slag. It increases the fluidity of slag. lime stone (CaCO3) is mostly used as flux. Coke is the fuel commonly used in cupola. The metal charge consists of pig iron (30%), new scrap iron (30%) and returns (sprue, gates, risers, and defective castings). 4. Melting After the cupola furnace has been fully charged, the charge is allowed to get heated slowly for about 45 minutes without allowing the air blast. This is called the soaking of iron. At the end of soaking period, the air blast is opened. The tapping hole is closed by means of a bolt or a plug till sufficient amount of molten metal gets accumulated inside the furnace. As the melting continues, additional charges are added and the charge level is kept upto the charging door during the entire operation of the cupola. 5. Slagging and Tapping After sufficient amount of molten metal gets accumulated inside the cupola, the slag hole is opened and the slag is removed through the spout. This process is called slagging. The plug closing the tap hole is then removed and the molten metal is taken out through tapping spout for pouring into the mould. This process is called tapping. 6. Dropping Down the Bottom Once sufficient amount of molten metal is taken out from the cupola, the charging is stopped.

    "text": "The most common type of defects in casting are as follows: Blow Holes Blow holes are cavities present inside the casting or on the surface of the casting. They are caused by the entrapped gases or steam in the casting. Because of molten metal, gases are generated and the moisture present in the moulding sand accounts for the steam. For avoiding blow holes, proper venting should be provided. Also the presence of gas producing ingredients in moulding sand should be avoided and the permeability of the moulding sand should be high. Due to low moisture content, blow holes will be considerably less in dry sand and skin dried moulding, compared to green sand moulding. The blow holes occurring on the surface are called open blows. Pin Holes Pin holes are large number of small holes occurring on the surface of the casting. This is caused by hydrogen or carbon monoxide picked up by the molten metal in the furnace or while transferring it for pouring. When the metal gets solidified, the solubility of these gases decreases. Hence, these gases are expelled out of the casting and during this process, these leave a number of small holes. Swell A swell is an enlargement of the mould cavity because of the pressure exerted by the molten metal. This causes some error in the dimensions of the casting. This can be avoided by a proper ramming of the moulding sand. Shrinkage Cavity Shrinkage cavity is a void or depression caused by shrinkage of the metal. This may be avoided by adequate risers and by proper mould design. Shift A shift is caused when there is mismatch of the sections of a casting usually at parting line. This can be avoided by proper alignment of the pattern, moulding boxes, etc. Drops Drop is caused by the falling of some loose moulding sand from the cope surface of the mould into the mould cavity. This leads to unwanted projections or cavities in the castings. This can be avoided by proper ramming and by using moulding sand having high green strength. Misruns Misruns are caused by the incomplete filling of the mould cavity by the molten metal. This leads to unfilled cavities in the casting. This defect can be avoided by having an increased fluidity of the metal and by avoiding the small thickness of the casting. Cold Shuts A cold shut is caused by incomplete fusion of the molten metal stream while meeting in the mould cavity. This leads to a discontinuity or a weak spot in the casting. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.59 This can be avoided by having increased fluidity of the metal and by avoiding too small thickness of the casting. Runout A runout is caused by the leakage of the molten metal out of the mould cavity. This leads to unwanted projections in the casting. This can be avoided by proper ramming while making the mould. Metal Penetration A metal penetration is caused by the entering of molten metal into the space between the grains of the moulding sand. This can be avoided by using moulding sands having lower permeability and smaller grains.",

Weld Pass A single movement of the welding torch or electrode along the length of the joint is called as a weld pass. Based on the thickness of the metal piece, welding can be completed in a singe or multi-pass. The weld pass in the root region is called as a root pass and subsequent passes for filling the joint are called as filler passes. Penetration The depth up to which the weld metal combines with parent metal is called metal penetration. It is measured from the top surface of the joint. Deposition Rate It is the rate at which the weld metal deposits in the joint per unit time. Tack Welds These are two small welds made at the end of the joint for temporarily holding the metal pieces.

    "text": "Arc welding is the process of joining two metal pieces by melting their edges with an electric arc. An arc is an electric discharge through the ionised gas column between two conductors of electricity namely the cathode and the anode. When two conductors are touched and then separated by a small distance, electrons are liberated from the cathode and move towards the anode. Also, the positively charged ions move from the anode towards the cathode. The impact of these electrons and positive ions at high velocity onto the conductors liberates heat. The temperature of the arc is about 3870°C. An arc useful for generating heat can be obtained between an electrode and the work piece, between two electrodes and also between two metal pieces to be welded. Figure 1.26 shows a schematic arrangement of an arc welding equipment. An alternating current or a direct current source can be used for arc welding process.

Direct current arc welding power sources are usually d.c. generators, whereas in the case of alternate current arc welding, the power sources are transformers. The electrode is held by means of an electrode holder and the work pieces are kept on a metal work table. The electrode holder and the metal work table are connected to different terminals of the welding power source by means of long insulated cables. Initially, the metal work piece is touched with the electrode and then separated leaving a small gap between the electrode tip and the work piece. In arc welding, the gap between the electrode and the work piece is important for the arc to exist continuously and it is known as the arc length. This has to be maintained within a specified range for good quality welding.

Heavy coated electrodes are provided with thick flux coatings. Many chemicals are added in flux coating for getting some specific advantages. Common flux materials with their functions are given below: Starch and wood pulp form a gas shield around the weld zone preventing it from atmospheric oxygen.

    "text": "Gas welding is the process of joining two metal pieces by melting their edges by a flame resulting from the burning of a gas fuel and oxygen. Oxygen acetylene combination is the most widely used in this process. The process using the above combination is called as oxy-acetylene welding. In gas welding, the flame is produced at the tip of a welding torch. It is used for heating the metal. A filler metal, in the form of a rod is added separately for filling the weld cavity. Gas welding is widely used for welding all ferrous and non- ferrous metals. Oxy-acetylene Welding In oxy-acetylene welding, the flame is produced by burning a mixture of oxygen and acetylene. This mixture burns to produce the high flame temperature upto 3480°C in a two stage reaction. In the first stage, oxygen and acetylene react to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen. C2H2 + O2 ® H2 + 2CO (1.4) This reaction occurs near the end of the torch tip. In the second stage, carbon monoxide and hydrogen react with oxygen forming carbon dioxide and water vapour respectively. 2CO + O2 ® 2CO2 (1.5) 2H2 + O2 ® 2H2O (1.6) These reactions occur just after the first combustion zone. The oxygen for above two reactions is obtained from the atmosphere. Based on the ratio of oxygen and acetylene in the mixture, the flame may be neutral, oxidizing or carburising flame. They are shown in . A neutral flame is obtained by supplying equal volumes of oxygen and acetylene. The neutral flame has two sharply defined zones, one inner white cone flame and an outer blue flame envelope. Neutral flame is used for welding steel, stainless steel, cast iron and copper.

A carburising flame has the two sharply defined zones as in case of a neutral flame with the addition of a third zone, whitish in colour known as intermediate flame feather. The carburising flame is used for welding monel, low-carbon steels and some alloy steels. An oxidising flame is obtained by supplying more volume of oxygen than acetylene. The oxidising flame is similar to neutral flame with two distinct zones. But, the inner white zone is much smaller than that of a neutral flame. Oxidising flame is used for welding copper and copper alloys. Figure 1.29 shows a schematic view of the equipment used for oxyacetylene welding. In this, oxygen and acetylene are to be supplied at a specified pressure range only. Hence, the gas cylinders are provided with pressure gauges and pressure regulators.

Half-nut lever 13. Dead centre 4. Tray 9. Cross-slide 14. Tool post 5. Carriage 10. Gear box 15. Compound rest  Centre lathe Scope of Civil Engineering 1.69 1. Bed The bed is the basic structure of the lathe and constitutes 70-90 percent of the total weight of the lathe. All other parts are fitted on to this bed. Two sets of parallel, longitudinal guideways are contained on the bed’s upper surface. These guideways are precision machined to ensure accurate alignments of other parts fitted on the bed. It is made strong enough to resist the deflec tions and vibrations due to cutting forces. The bed is usually made of cast iron or nickel cast iron alloy. 2. Head Stock The head stock is mounted at the left end of the bed. It provides the power required for rotating the work at various speeds and for the tool movement as well. The head stock receives the drive from an electrical motor and it makes use of the cone pulleys and gears for getting various spindle speeds. There are speed change levers on the head stock for this purpose. The head stock also contains work holding devices such as chucks, face plates and dog plates on it. The head stock mounts the live centre. 3. Tail Stock The tail stock is mounted at the right end of the bed. It mounts the dead centre. It can be moved along the lathe bed for accommodating work pieces of different sizes. It is mainly used for the following purposes: (a) To support one end of a long work piece (b) To hold a tool for the operations like drilling, reaming, tapping, etc. 4. Carriage The carriage provides the means for mounting and moving the cutting tools. The carriage has the following parts: (a) The saddle: It is H-shaped casting fitted onto the bed and moves along the outer set of guideways on the bed surface. (b) The cross slide: It is mounted on a transverse bar on the saddle and can be moved by means of the feed screw that is controlled by a small hand wheel. The cross slide is used to move the cutting tool along a perpendicular direction to the axis of rotation of the work piece. (c) The compound rest: It consists of a base, which is mounted on the cross slide and an upper casting. The base is graduated in angle for swivel of the compound rest through any angle. The upper casting is mounted on guide ways on the base. It can be moved along the guide ways by a hand wheel. (d) The tool post: It is mounted on the compound rest. The cutting tool is clamped in the tool post. (e) The Apron: It is attached to the front of the carriage. It contains the mecha nism for the manual and automatic motion of the carriage and the cross slide. For the manual movement of the carriage along the bed, there is a hand wheel on the front of the apron. The hand wheel shaft has a pinion at its other end which engages with a rack attached to the bed. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.70 5. Feed Mechanism The power is transmitted to the apron through the feed mechanism. It is located at the left of the bed. Power is transmitted to the apron by a rotating feed rod through the gearing and clutch arrangement in the apron. For cutting threads, the drive is given by a lead screw by a direct connection between the apron and the lead screw by means of a split nut. 1.23.2 Important operations done on a lathe 1. Turning Turning is a lathe operation in which the diameter of cylindrical jobs is reduced to the desired dimensions. In turning, the work piece is held between the lathe centres or in a chuck. The tool is clamped in the tool post. The work piece is rotated and tool is fed parallel to the axis of rotation, as shown in . Turning operation resulting in the same diameter over the full length of the work piece is called straight turning and when different diame ters are obtained, it is called step- turning or shoulder turning. 2. Knurling In knurling, the surface of the work piece is made rough for easy gripping as shown in . The knurling tool consists of two or more hardened steel rollers which have diamond patterns on their surface. These patterns are formed on the surface of the work piece by pressing the knurling tool against the rotating work piece. Dead centre Knurling tool Workpiece  Knurling 3. Forming The required profile is obtained by pressing a form tool against the surface of the rotating work piece. Forming can produce concave, convex or any irregular shape as shown in . Dead centre Feed Turning tool Workpiece  Turning Convex shape Concave shape W orklpeice  Form turning Scope of Civil Engineering 1.71 4. Grooving and Parting Off Grooving is the operation by which some grooves or neckings are produced on the work piece as shown in . Parting off is the operation by which one section of a work piece is cut or parted off from the remainder by means of a parting off tool. The tools used for this are thin as shown in the . Both the above operations are done by feeding the tool into the work piece at a proper and uniform rate. Workpieces Workpieces Parting tool Feed Parting off Feed Feed Parting tool Groovig Chuck  Grooving and parting-off 5. Drilling Drilling is the operation by which a hole is produced in the work piece. For drilling, the work piece is rotated by holding in a chuck while the drilling tool is held in the tail stock and fed into the work piece. This can be seen in . Workpiece Drill bit  Drilling Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.72 6. Reaming Reaming is the operation by which the dimension of a drilled hole is corrected. This is similar to drilling, but the reaming is more accurate and involves very little metal removal. The reaming operation is shown in . Workpiece Reamer fig 1.39 Reaming 7. Boring Boring is the operation by which a drilled hole is enlarged. For boring, the work piece is rotated by holding in a chuck and the boring tool fitted on the tool post is fed into the work piece for enlarging the holes drilled which can be seen in . If the enlarging is done only through some length of the work piece, it is called counter boring as given in . Workpiece Boring tool Tool  Counter boring 8. Taper Turning Taper turning is the operation by which the tapered surface is produced on the work piece. For taper tuning, any one of the following methods can be adopted: (a) By using a form tool as in . Chuck Job Form tool  Taper turning by a form tool (b) By tail stock set over method as in . Scope of Civil Engineering 1.73 + + + Tailstock centre Set over Headstock centre  Taper turning by tail stock set over 9. Thread Cutting Thread cutting is the operation by which threads are formed on the surface of the work piece. Thread cutting on a lathe is done by making use of a special arrangement in the carriage and the lead screw. The special arrangement is the half nut which can be engaged with the lead screw as shown in . This engagement makes the cutting tool to move through distance equal to one pitch of the thread for one revolution of the work piece. For obtaining different pitches on the work, the speed of the lead screw is changed by engaging proper change gears between the head stock spindle and the lead screw. Headstock spindle Carrier Work Tailstock Carriage Load screw Idle gear Driver Change gears Driver  Thread cutting The change gear may be selected by the following calculation: = Number of teeth on the spindle gear Pitch of the thread to be cut Number of teeth on the lead screw Pitch of lead screw threads",

Mechanical engineering is mainly involved in production work in industries, for which they need large number of buildings which can be constructed by civil engineers. For construction work, we need large amount of cement. Though civil engineers may buy from the marked, it is manufactured by mechanical engineers is cement factory. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 1.76 Now-a-days, multistoried buildings are very common in all countries. In 1956, at New York, USA, I was thrilled to see very large number of multistoried buildings, including the Empire States building, the tallest in the world. For lifting building materials for the construction of such tall buildings, mechanical engineering comes to help. One of the main functions of civil engineering is the construction of buildings. Mechanical engineering is mainly involved in production work in industries, for which they need large number of building, which can be constructed by civil engineers. For the construction of various types of industrial structures in pharmaceutical industry, food industry, paper industry, automobile industry, etc. civil engineers and different disciplines engineers like bio-medical engineers, chemical engineers, automobile engineers, biotech engineers, etc. work together. Few examples are listed as follows: 1. Ventilation facilities especially in multi-storied building, fire safety in buildings and industries where civil, mechanical and fire safety engineers have to work together. 2. In health sector, doctors, health care officers, educationalists, municipal officers, taluk and district administrators have to interact with civil and mechanical Engineers for the construction of specialized hospitals and Educational Institutions. Construction of dust and microorganism free operation theatres, tissue banks, wards for patients of cancer and burns in hospitals demand great coordination. 3. Clean room constructions for the pharmaceutical industry, RandD centres, demand great coordination of civil and Bio-medical Engineers . 4. Few of the tough and large scale activities are construction of steel industry, paper industry, dams, bridges, tunnels, metal ores like iron, gold, etc. In which civil, mechanical and chemical engineers are required to coordinate. 5. In the transport sector, civil and mechanical engineers work together in executing facilities like roadways and railways. 6. For the construction of automobile industries, civil engineers require the coordination with mechanical and automobile engineers. 7. Marine engineers have to coordinate with civil and mechanical engineers for establishment of harbors, huge container handling cranes and naval structures. 8. Aeronautical and aerospace engineers have to interact with civil and mechanical engineers for the development of airports, aircraft manufacturing and rocket launching pads. 9. In food production, they work together in industries like fertilizers, production of pesticides, sugar industry, confectionary industries, to produce and preserve milk products like milk, cheese, butter, ghee, butter milk, milk powder, yogurt etc. Significant contributions are made in construction of the walk-in type of cold storages to preserve food materials where cooperation between civil and biotech engineers is needed. Scope of Civil Engineering 1.77 10. Architects’ and town planners’ interaction with civil engineers is also essential for the infrastructure development, construction of energy conserving and environment friendly buildings. Recently, Government of India has planned many smart cities. Smart city concepts have great future to create safe living or work places. In this aspect, the cooperation of architects and civil engineers is needed. 11. The two engineering fields contribute tremendously, either to reduce the losses or for a quick recovery, at the time of natural or manmade calamities. Few of the techniques are listed as follows: ∑ To reduce the chances of land slides in the hills, especially near the dams, concept of fixing cement concrete pivots on the sloping surfaces of a hill is used. ∑ To reduce the possibilities of land erosion along the river beds articulated concrete blocks are used and in the coastal regions tetrahedral concrete structures are used. ∑ Forest fires are brought under control with the help of equipment designed by civil and mechanical engineers. ∑ Earthquake resisting foundations and buildings are available with the help of civil and mechanical engineering. ∑ Building designs to resist or minimise the losses while encountering tsunami waves. 12. Infrastructure development includes suitable electric supply, Internet, telephones, good healthcare and therefore, civil engineers have to interact with electrical, communication and bio-medical engineering professionals. 13. Civil engineers and mechanical engineers coordinate with electrical engineers for the design, constructions and maintenance of the power plants like thermal power plant, hydro power plant, nuclear power plant and non-conventional power plants. 14. Constructions and maintenance of seawater desalination systems like Multi- Stage Flashing (MSF), Multi-Effect Desalination, Reverse Osmosis, or any other desalination plant where civil and mechanical engineers collaboration is required. 15. Software application is becoming more important and efficient in the project planning, estimation, analysis, design and stability of civil engineering structures and hence the role of software engineers in the civil engineering sectors becomes inevitable. Thus, Civil Engineers should understand the importance of interdisciplinary approach in their planning, construction and erection activities to avoid criticism from any corner of the society. Though Civil and Mechanical Engineering professionals have their own systems in place in their fields, if other engineers play an interdisciplinary role, it will enhance values to their systems.

After the plans are made, the structures must be stated out on the ground. As the work progresses, lines and grades must be given.",

As the plane survey extends only over small areas, the line connecting two points on the earth is considered as a straight line and the angle between any two lines is considered as plane angle. Surveys covering an area up to 260 km2 may be treated as plane surveys. Such plane surveys are carried out for engineering projects and for geographical, geological, navigational and military purposes. Plane surveys are used for the layout of highways, railways, canals, construction of bridges, dams, buildings, etc. The scope and use of plane surveying is wide.

The surveying in which curvature of the earth is taken into account for all measurements is known as geodetic surveying. The result obtained from the above surveying will possess a high degree of accuracy as it considers the effect of curvature of the earth also. This surveying extends over large areas and so any line connecting two points on the earth’s surface is considered as an arc. The angle between any two such arcs is treated as a spherical angle. To undertake this method of surveying, a through knowledge in spherical trigonometry is required. Geodetic surveys need sophisticated instruments and accurate methods of observations. In order to eliminate the errors in observations due to atmospheric refraction, angular observations are generally taken only in nights and arc lamps are used as signals on survey stations. In India, geodetic surveys are carried out by the Department of the Survey of India under the direction of the Surveyor General of India.",

It is also done to fix the boundaries of municipalities and of state & federal jurisdictions. (iii) City surveying City surveying is done in connection with the construction of streets, water supply systems, sewers and other works. (b) Marine (or) hydrographic surveys It deals with the bodies of water for purpose of navigation, water supply, harbour works or for the determination of mean sea level. The work consist in measurement of discharge of streams, making topography survey of shores and banks, taking and locating soundings to determine the depth of water and observing the fluctuations of the ocean tide. (c) astronomical survey It offers the surveyor means of determining the absolute locations of any point or the absolute location and direction of any line on the surface of the earth. This consists of observation of heavenly bodies such as sun or any fixed star. 2. classification Based Upon the objective of Survey  (a) engineering surveys These are carried out for the determination of quantities which will be useful for the designing of engineering works. (b) Military or defence surveys These are carried out for the preparation of maps of important military areas. (c) geological surveys These are carried out to ascertain the composition of the earth’s crust. (d) Mine surveys These are conducted for exploring the mineral wealth below the earth surface. (e) archaeological surveys These are executed to prepare maps of ancient cultures. 3. classification Based Upon Methods employed (a) Triangulation surveys (b) Traverse surveys The framework in traverse survey consists of series of connected lines. The lengths and directions of these lines are measured with a chain or tape and with an angular measurement respectively. A traverse is divided into two categories: closed traverse normal open traverse. A description of the two types of traverse is provided in this section. 1. Closed Traverse A traverse is said to be closed if a complete circuit is made, i.e. the origin and end point are one and the same thereby the circuit forms a closed polygon. This is particularly suitable for locating a building, boundaries of lakes, wooded lands, etc. A closed traverse is shown in . Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 2.4 2. Open Traverse A traverse is said to be open if it does not form a closed polygon. It consists of a series of survey lines extending in one general direction but never returning to the starting point as shown in . 4. classification Based Upon the Instruments Used  (a) Chain surveying (b) Compass surveying (c) Plane table surveying (d) Theodolite surveying (e) Tacheometric surveying (f) Aerial surveying (g) Photographic surveying",

Working from the whole to the part Whether it is a plane surveyor or a geodetic survey, the main principle adopted is to work from the whole to the part. In the case of surveying of extensive areas, such as a town or a big estate, the survey is started by establishing a system of control points with high precision. The line joining these points will form the boundary lines of the area, otherwise, this is the main skeleton of the survey. The above control points may be established by triangulation or by running a traverse surrounding the area. The main triangles and traverses are then broken into smaller ones and measured using less laborious methods. The main reason to work from the whole to the part is to avoid the accumulation of errors and to control any localised errors. If, on the other hand, the survey is carried out from the part to the whole, the errors will be magnified in each and every step and will become uncontrollable at the end. The above principle is also fit to the levelling also.

This method consists in of counting the number of paces between the two points of a line. A length of pace more nearly to that of ones natural step is preferable. Passometer It is an instrument, shaped like a watch and is carried in pocket or attached to one leg. The mechanism of the instrument is operated by motion of the body and it automatically registers the number of paces. Then it can be multiplied by the average length of the pace to get the distance. Pedometer It is similar to the passometer except that it, is adjusted to the length of the pace of the person carrying it. It registers the total distance covered by any number of paces. Odometer and Speedometer Odometer is an instrument for registering the number of revolutions of a wheel. The odometer is fitted to a wheel which is rolled along the line whose length is required. The number of revolutions registered by the odometer can be multiplied by the circumference of the wheel to get the distance.

The ends of the chain are provided with brass handles with swivel joints so that the chain can be turned round without twisting. The outside of the handle is the zero point or the end of the chain.

They, however, possess the following disadvantages: (i) It is necessary to put the appropriate cardinal points without which the bearings will have no significance. (ii) The alternate clockwise and anti clockwise direction of increase of angle in the different quadrants is sometimes inconvenient and may very easily lead to mistakes being made. (iii) The noting of the cardinal points may prove to be an extra unnecessary trouble. The following at the advantages of this system: (i) It is easy to calculate the included angle between two lines with the help of this system of bearings. (ii) The convention of reckoning the bearing clockwise from the magnetic north is so simple that it is not necessary to remember whether the bearings are observed with reference to the north meridian or south meridian. (iii) The plotting of traverse becomes easy because the bearings are to be measured only in the clockwise direction. (iv) There is no botheration of putting the cardinal points. The only drawback of this system is that when the bearings are to be used for computation and where the values of the trigonometrical functions are required, they are to be reduced to their equivalent values.",

Such disturbance due to the surrounding magnetic field is called local attraction. The readings observed will be affected due to the presence of magnetic rocks or iron-ore deposits, steel structures, railways, iron lamp posts, electrical steel towers, etc. The actual bearing may be affected if we carelessly keep a bunch of iron keys, knife, iron buttons, steel-framed spectacles, the chain itself, arrows, etc. near the instrument. To detect its presence, one has to find the fore and back bearing of a line and obtain the difference between them. If the difference is not exactly equal to 180° then it indicates the presence of local attraction, provided there are no instrumental and observational errors. 2.8.6 Traversing with compass and chain In compass traversing, the instrument is set at each station successively and the fore and back bearings of each line are noted in the field note book. The errors in this survey tend to compensate as each bearing is observed independently. Distances between the successive stations are measured using the chain.

    "text": "Levelling may be classified as simple levelling and differential levelling. 1. Simple Levelling Figure 2.20 illustrates simple levelling. Simple leveling is the easiest way adopted to find the difference in level between any two points. Let A and B are the two points and O be the station point placed approximately midway between A and B. Station O need not lie on the line joining A and B. The reading of the staff at A is first taken. Let this be h1. Then, the reading of the staff h2 at B is noted after adjusting the bubble to be at the centre. The difference between the two readings, i.e, h1 – h2 gives the difference in level between A and B. If reduced level of A is 100, then, RL of B can be found as follows: Height of instrument at O = 100 + h1 Rl Of B = 100 + h1– h2 Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 2.22 h2 h1 B O  Simple levelling 2. Differential Levelling Differential levelling is illustrated in . If it is necessary to find the difference in elevation between two points which are too far apart or if there are any obstacles between them or if the difference in elevation is high then differential levelling is adopted. This is a simple levelling adopted in successive stages. Hence, it is also known as compound or continuous levelling. a e1 d2 d1 c2 A O1 B C O2 O3 D O4 E c1 b2 b2  Differential levelling Let A and E be two points whose difference in elevation is necessary. The staff reading at A is noted as a from station point O1. After adjusting the bubble, the staff reading at a firm point B is noted from O1 as b1. The staff reading a is the back sight and b, is the foresight. B is selected such that AOI is approximately equal to O1B. Now, the instrument is shifted to O2 and the staff reading at B, from O2 is taken and noted as b2. Another firm point C is selected and the procedure is repeated till the point E is reached. The difference in level between A and B is (a – b1). The difference in level between B and C is (b2 – c1) and so on. The difference in level between A and E are the algebraic sum of these differences. 3. Reciprocal Levelling This is a method of finding the difference in elevation between two points by making reciprocal observations when the site conditions do not allow to set up the level between the two stations.  Surveying 2.23 On occasions, we come across a need to run a line of levels across a wide gap like a river or a deep valley or ravine. The site conditions do not allow to place the level anywhere so that the Foresight and the Back sight distances are even approximately equal. The site conditions also do not permit to set up the instrument exactly midway between stations on either side of the gap. In view of the large sight lengths the errors due to curvature and refraction and non adjustment of the instrument become important. In such situation reciprocal levelling can be performed by which correct difference of levels can be determined taking into account the error due to curvature and refraction as well as collimation error.   Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 2.24 Let A and B be two stations on opposite banks of a river or stream. Let A be at a higher level than B. Let D be the horizontal distance between A and B. Suppose the line of collimation of the instrument is elevated. Refer . The instrument is set up on the left side of A in line with AB at a distance d from A. Let ha and hb be the staff reading obtained over A and B respectively. Refer . Correct staff reading at A = ha – K1d – K2d2 Correct staff reading at B = hb – K1(D + d) – K2(D + d)2 where K1 = Coefficient to correct for collimation error K2 = Coefficient to correct for curvature and refraction True Difference of Level = h = [hb – K1(D + d) – K2(D + d)2] – [ha – K1d – K2d2] Now the instrument is set up on the other bank on the right side of B in line with BA at a distance d from B. Refer . Correct staff reading at A = ha¢ – K1(D + d) – K2(D + d)2 Correct staff reading at B = hb¢ – K1d – K2d2 True Difference of Level = h = [hb¢ – K1d – K2d2] – [ha¢ – K1(D + d) – K2(D + d)2] Adding above equations of true differences of level, we get 2h = [hb – ha] + [hb¢ – ha¢] True difference of level = h = {[hb – ha] + [hb¢ – ha¢]}/2",

    "text": "There are two methods for calculating the reduced levels of points, the height of collimation or height of instrument method and the rise and fall method. In this section, these methods are discussed. 1. The Height of Collimation or Height of Instrument Method In this method, the height of instrument (HI) is calculated for each setting by adding the back sight (BS) to the elevation of BM. The reduced level of the first station or of the intermediate station can be obtained by subtracting the foresight at the first station or the intermediate sight at the intermediate station. For the second setting HI is calculated by adding the back sight taken on the second point to its reduced level. The reduced level of the last point is obtained by subtracting the foresight of the last point from the HI at the last setting. Arithmetic check can be done in the following manner. S BS – S FS = Last RL – First RL This method is simple, easy and rapid. Surveying 2.25 2. Rise and Fall Method In this method, the difference of level between two consecutive points for each setting of the instrument is obtained by comparing their staff readings. A rise is indicated if the back sight reading is greater than the foresight and a fall is shown if it is less than the foresight reading. The rise and fall worked out for all the points give the level difference of each point with respect to the preceding one. If the RL of the back staff point is known, the RL of the following point can be obtained by subtracting its fall from the RL of the preceding point or by adding its rise to the RL of the preceding point. Arithmetic check is done as explained below: S BS – S FS = S Rise – S Fall = Last RL – First RL",

Areas between the survey lines and boundaries In this method illustrated in . Then, the area between survey line and boundary line can be measured by the following rules. F A E B D C  (a) Trapezoidal rule This is based on the assumption that the figures are trapezoids. The base line AB is divided into equal parts. The ordinates are measured and their lengths are scaled off. This procedure is explained in .  h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 h8 d  h1, h2,…, h – length of ordinates at equal intervals n – number of divisions A B C D E F G H O  Surveying 2.27 L – length of the base line d – distance between adjacent ordinates Note: If h1 or hn is equal to zero, that is also included in the formula. Total area, A = d __ 2 (h1 +2h2 +2h3 + ... + 2hn–1 + hn) = d __ 2 [first ordinate + 2 (sum of intermediate ordinates) + last ordinate] (b) Simpson’s rule As illustrated in . But total area is given by: A = d __ 3 [h1 + hn + 2 (h3 + h5 + h7 + ... + hn – 2) + 4 (h2 + h4 + ... + hn–1)] i.e., A = d __ 3 [First ordinate + Last ordinate + 2 (sum of odd ordinates) + 4 (sum of remaining even ordinates)]  h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 h8 d A  Note: (i) This rule is applicable only if the number of ordinates is odd. If the number of ordinates is even, the area of the last trapezoid is calculated separately and added to the result. From . The area for first seven ordinates can be obtained by applying Simpson’s rule, A1 = d __ 3 [h1 + 2(h3 + h5) + 4(h2 + h4 + h6) + h7] A2 = 1 __ 2 (h7 + h8) × d Then, total area A = A1 + A2. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 2.28 (ii) If h1 or hn is zero that is also included in the rule. The results obtained using the Simpson’s rule are more accurate than those obtained by the Trapezoidal rule. Comparison b/w Trapezoidal and Simpson’s rule The results obtained by the use of Simpson’s rule are more accurate in all cases. The results obtained by using ‘Simpson’s rule are greater or smaller than those obtained by using the trapezoidal rule according as the curve of the boundary is concave of convex towards the base line. In dealing with irregularly shaped figures, the degree of precision of either method can be increased by increasing the number of ordinates. Mid-ordinate rule The method is used with the assumption that the boundaries between the extremities of the ordinates (or offsets) are straight line. The base line is divided in to a number of divisions and the ordinates are measured at the mid-points of each division, as illustrated in . O1 O2 O3 O4 On O n A B 2 4 L nd = d d F N B E W D C Iii I S A b Ii a q q  Surveying 2.29 The average ordinate rule will not give correct results if the range of values of the ordinates is large. The trapezoidal rule and Simpson’s rule are the most commonly used rules. Simpson’s rule is considered generally more accurate, as the assumption of a curved boundary is more realistic compared to the assumption of a straight-line boundary between ordinates made in the trapezoidal rule. The method of coordinates and the trapezoidal rule give the same results, as both are based on the same assumption. If the boundary is concave towards the survey line, the Trapezoidal rule will calculate less area than the Simpson’s rule, while if the boundary is convex towards the survey line, Simpson’s rule will calculate a lower value.",

The given WCB is between 0° and 90°. So, WCB = RB 20° 30¢ = N 20° 30¢E 2. The given WCB is between 90° and 180°. So, RB = 180° – WCB = 180° – 176° 10¢ = S 3° 50¢E 3. Here, WCB lies between 180° and 270°. So, RB = WCB – 180° = 220° 30¢ – 180° = S 40° 30¢ W 4. WCB lies between 270° and 360°.

Calculate the area enclosed between the survey one and the boundary line by the trapezoidal rule and the Simpson’s rule.  Solution In this problem, there are seven ordinates.

In every society, the role of engineers is to develop the technological application to meet practical needs. For example, the application of an electrical system is to provide power to a city, a water wheel is to run a mill, an artificial heart is to prolong life, etc. The systems that supply our food, water, fuel, power, transportation network, communication and other conveniences are the products of engineering skill. Despite the essential part engineers play in the above progress and in the well-being of humanity, their exact role is imperfectly understood. Engineering is the art of converting knowledge into useful practical applications. An engineer is a person, who plays the key role in this process of conversion. Since engineering is the profession which serves people, their environment is an important consideration. Often, there have been difficulties in distinguishing engineers from scientists. It is difficult to determine where the work of the scientist ends and that of the engineer begins. The basic distinction between the linked professions of science and engineering lies in their goals. Scientists aim to invent while engineers strive to use the inventions effectively to cater to the needs of mankind. For example, the German physicist Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves while Guglielmo Marconi developed wireless telegraphy using radio waves, a feat of engineering. And after the scientific principles of nuclear fission were established, the hard work of creating atomic weapons and useful power plants was accomplished by electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers.",

Surveying is defined as an art of collecting data for mapping the relative positions of points on the surface of the earth. Levelling is the process of determining the relative heights of the points on the surface of earth in a vertical plane. The main purpose of the survey work is to prepare the plan of the object to be surveyed. Various instruments are used to measure and collect the necessary information to draw the plan. Remote sensing uses the technique of obtaining the data about an area by taking aerial photographs. The intelligent interpretation gives a clear picture of the terrain.",

First-class bricks are table-moulded and of standard shape. These comply with all good qualities of bricks and are used for superior and permanent works. 2. Second-class bricks are ground-moulded and burnt in kilns. The surfaces of such bricks are rough and are slightly irregular in shape. Such bricks are used with a coat of plaster. 3. Third-class bricks are ground-moulded and are burnt in clamps. These bricks are not hard but rough with irregular and distorted edges. These give a dull sound when struck with each other. They are used for unimportant and temporary structures and at places where there is less rainfall. 4. Overburnt bricks with irregular shape and dark colour are classified as the fourth class bricks.

    "text": "1. Alumina It is the chief constituent of clay. A good brick should have 20–30 per cent of alumina. This imparts plasticity to the earth. 2. Silica It exists in clay in a free or combined form. A good brick earth should contain about 50–60 per cent of silica. The presence of silica prevents cracking, shrinking and warping of raw bricks. It imparts uniform shape to bricks. The durability depends on proper proportion of silica. 3. Lime Up to 5 per cent of lime is desirable in good brick earth. It prevents shrinkage in raw bricks. Sand alone is infusible, but it fuses at kiln temperature due to the presence of lime. Bricks may melt and lose their shape due to excess of lime content. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.7 4. Oxide of iron This gives the red colour to bricks. A small quantity of iron oxide up to 5 or 6 per cent is desirable. 5. Magnesia This imparts yellow tints to bricks and it reduces shrinkage. Advantages of using bricks The following are the advantages of bricks over other construction materials, like stone, concrete etc., (a) Bricks are cheaper and easy to handle. (b) They are of standard size and hence easy to have proper bonding. (c) Consumes less mortar when compared to stone masonry. (d) Labour required for brick masonry is less. (e) Brick walls can be raised to a larger height, when compared to stone masonry. (f) Because of regular size the surface of wall will be plane and given a neat appearance. (g) Brick masonry consumes, less mortar for plastering. (h) Easy to drill holes for fixing service connection line. (i) Bricks have low thermal conductivity and high sound insulation properties. (j) They possess very high resistance to fire. (k) They are non–combustible and non–inflammable. Disadvantages of using bricks (a) The compressive strength of brick is less compared to stone and concrete. (b) Water absorption is more than that of stone or concrete. (c) Only a selected variety of clay can be used for manufacture of bricks (d) Kilns are required to be constructed for manufacturing bricks.

    "text": "The following are the field tests by judgment for assessing the quality of bricks. Field tests 1. The bricks should be truly rectangular in shape with sharp edges and plane faces and of the same size. 2. They should be hard and well burnt and should give a metallic ringing sound when struck with a steel rod. 3. They should be of uniform red colour and of fine texture. 4. When the bricks are dropped on the ground from one metre height, they should not crack or break. 5. They should be free from cracks, fissures, pebbles or nodules of free lime. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.8 Lab Tests 1. Test for water absorptions (a) 3 samples of clean well dried bricks are taken and their dry weight is found out individually. (b) The bricks are then immersed in water for 24 hours. (c) After 24 hours, the bricks are taken out, surface dried and weighed in a balance and wet weight found out. (d) If the wet weight of each bricks is W2, the percentage water absorption of each brick = W2 – W1 ________ W1 × 100 (e) The average percentage of water absorption of three samples is the water absorption of the bricks. Required standard The average absorption should not be greater than 20%. Too much of water absorption indicates under burnt condition and poor strength. 2. Test for efflorescence (For the presence of salt) Salts like sulphates of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium present in the brick will cause efflorescence on the brick surface, when they get dissolved in water. Bricks containing too much of salt are less resistant to weathering and will have poor strength. 1. Three samples of bricks are immersed in good water for 24 hours. 2. After 24 hours, the bricks are taken out and examined for white patches of salt on the surfaces. 3. If the white patches of salt present are heavy, the bricks are poor and are to be rejected. 4. If the while patches present are small to medium, the bricks can be accepted. 3. Test for compressive strength The load carrying capacity of bricks is increased, as the compressive strength increases. (a) Three samples of bricks are taken and immersed in good water for 24 hours. (b) After 24 hours of immersion, the bricks are taken out and surface dried. (c) Each brick is placed on the compression testing machine and the load on the brick is gradually increased until the brick fails. The failure load of each brick is found out. (d) Average failure load of the 3 bricks is the compressive strength of the bricks. Requirement standards 1. Country Bricks Æ 3.5 to 5.0 N/mm2 2. II Class bricks Æ 5.0 to 7.5 N/mm2 3.

    "text": "The following are the four processes involved in the manufacture of bricks. 1. Preparation of brick earth 2. Moulding of bricks 3. Drying of bricks 4. Burning of bricks 1. Preparation of Brick Earth Preparation of brick earth involves the following operations. (i) Removal of loose soil (ii) Digging, Spreading and Cleaning (iii) Weathering (iv) Blending (v) Tempering (i) Removal of loose soil The top layer of the loose soil about 20cm depth contains lot of impurities and hence it should be taken out and thrown away. (ii) Digging, spreading and cleaning The earth is then dug out from the ground. This earth is spread into heaps about 60 cm to 120 cm height. All the undesirable matters like stones, vegetable matter etc. are removed. Lumps of clay should be converted into powder form. (iii) Weathering The earth is then exposed to atmosphere for softening. The period of exposure varies from weeks to full season. (iv) Blending The clay is then mixed with suitable ingredients. It is carried out by taking a small portion of clay every time and by turning it up and down in vertical direction. (v) Tempering This is done to make the whole mass of clay homogenous and plastic. Required water is added to clay and the whole mass is kneaded under the feet of men or cattle. When bricks are manufactured on a large scale, tempering is usually done in a pug mill. A pug mill consists of a conical iron tub with cover at its top. A vertical shaft with horizontal arms is provided at the centre of iron tub. Several cutting blades are attached to this horizontal arm. The clay with water is put inside the mill and the vertical shaft is rotated by bullocks or stream, diesel or electric power. Due to the action of the horizontal arms the clay is thoroughly mixed and tempered. 2. Moulding of Bricks The tempered clay is then sent for the next operation of moulding. There are two methods of moulding. (i) Hand moulding (ii) Machine moulding 1. Hand Moulding This is done by a mould which is a rectangular box with open at top and bottom. It may be of wood or steel. Following are the ways of hand moulding: (a) Ground moulding (b) Table moulding Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.10 (a) Ground moulding First a small portion of ground is cleaned and leveled. Fine sand is sprinkled over it. Moulding is started from one end of the ground. Mould is dipped in water and kept on the ground and clay is pressed by hand nicely so that all is again dipped in water and it is placed just near the previous brick to prepare another brick. Process is repeated till the ground is covered with bricks. A mark of depth about 10 mm to 20 mm is placed on raw brick by a pallet during moulding. This mark is called as frog. After the bricks become sufficiently dry, they are sent for the next process of drying. (b) Table moulding This should be done by an experienced supervisor. The moulder stands near a table of size about 2 m × 1m. Clay, mould water pots, stock board, strikes and pallet boards are placed on this table. Bricks are moulded on the table and sent for the next process of drying. 2. Machine moulding When bricks are manufactured in huge quantity at the same spot then moulding is done by machines. These machines contain a rectangular opening of size equal to the length and width of the brick. The Tampered clay is placed in the machine and as it comes out through the opening under pressure it is cut into strips by wire fixed in frames. Arrangement is made in such a way that strips of thickness equal to that of the brick are obtained. The machine moulded bricks have sharp edges and corners, smooth external surface and uniform texture. 3. Drying of Bricks After the bricks are moulded they are dried. This is done on specially prepared drying yards. Bricks are stacked in the yard with 8 to 10 bricks in each row. Bricks are dried for a period of 5 to 12 days. During drying it must be protected from wind, rain and direct sun. Sometimes, bricks, are dried artificially by hot gases from kiln. But there is change of warping of bricks in case of artificial drying. After drying, the bricks are sent for the next operation of burning. 4. Burning of Bricks Burning imparts hardness and strength to bricks and makes them dense and durable. It must be done carefully and properly because underburnt bricks remain soft and hence cannot carry loads and overburnt bricks become brittle and hence, break easily. Burning of bricks is done either in clamp or in kilns.",

    "text": "Building stones are obtained from rocks. It is essential to have some knowledge about rocks in order to study the properties of stones. Rocks are mainly classified into igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of the molten material from beneath the earth’s surface. Stones from these rocks are said to be harder. Granite which is widely used in building constructions is a good example. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.11 Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of weathering products on existing rocks. Deposits are in layers and when load is applied along the layers these rocks easily split. Metamorphic rocks are formed by the change in character of the pre-existing rocks. These will be hard if the basic rock is an igneous rock.",

    "text": "1. The crushing strength of stone should be greater than 100 N/mm2. All igneous rocks have a strength around 100 N/mm2 and some of the metamorphic rocks also satisfy this requirement. Sedimentary rocks have a lower strength. 2. Stones must be decent in appearance and be of uniform colour. Light coloured stones resist weathering action in a better way and hence preferred. 3. Stones must be durable. For the stones to be durable, their natural bed must be perpendicular to the direction of pressure. 4. Stones should be such that these can be easily carved and dressed. This property is opposed to strength and hardness but this depends upon the situation in which the stone is used. 5. For a good building stone its fracture should be sharp and clear. 6. If the stone is to be used in road work, it should be hard enough to resist wear and tear. 7. A good building stone must have a wear less than 3 per cent. If it is equal to 3 per cent, it is just tolerable while if it is more than 3 per cent it is not satisfactory. 8. Stones must be fire resistant, i.e., these must retain their shape when a fire occurs. Limestone resists fire up to about 800°C. Sandstones can resist fire in a better way. Argillaceous stones are poor in strength, but resist fire to some extent. 9. A good stone should not contain quarry sap which is nothing but moisture present in the stones. 10. A good building stone must have a specific gravity greater than 2.7. 11. A good stone must have a compact, fine, crystalline structure, strong and durable. 12. A good stone should not absorb water more than 0.6 per cent by weight. It must be capable of withstanding effects of atmosphere. 13. A good building stone must be acid resistant and free from any soluble matter. Stones with exposed faces are acted upon by various atmospheric agencies such as wind, frost, living organisms, alternate wetness and drying, movement of chemicals and rain water. Stones can be prevented from the effects of these agencies if preserved properly. Coal tar, linseed oil, paint, paraffin, a solution of alum and soap, and a solution of baryta are some of the commonly used preservatives. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.12",

Quarrying of soft and hard rocks is done by the following methods: 1. Digging, heating or wedging: In soft rocks like limestone and marble, stones are obtained by digging, heating or wedging using hand tools, namely, pick-axes, hammers, chisels, etc. 2. Blasting: In hard and dense rocks, stones are obtained by blasting using explosives. 3.4.4 dressing of stones Stones obtained after quarrying have rough surfaces and are irregular in shape and size. Dressing is the process of cutting the stones to a regular shape and size and the required surface finish. The purposes of dressing are: 1. To prepare the stones for a suitable size for any handling and transport. 2. To prepare the stones into a regular shape and pleasing appearance, with neat horizontal and vertical mortar joints between the adjacent stones. 3.

    "text": "To determine the suitability of stones for construction work, the following tests are conducted: 1. Hardness test Hardness of a stone is tested by a pen knife which will not be able to produce a scratch on a hard stone. Hardness number is determined using Mohr’s scale of hardness. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.13 2. Impact Test Impact test is carried out on an Impact Testing Machine to determine the toughness of a stone. In this test, a cylinder of 25 mm diameter and 25 mm height is taken out from the sample of the stone. A steel hammer of 2 kg weight is allowed to fall axially on the cylinder from 1 cm height for the first flow, 2 cm height for the second blow, 3 cm height for the third flow, and so on. The blow at which the specimen breaks is noted. If it is the nth blow, n represents the Toughness Index of the stone. 3. Test for crushing strength In this test, a cube of sample stone of size 40 mm × 40 mm × 40 mm is tested in a compression Testing Machine. The rate of axial loading on the cube is 13.7 N/mm2/ minute. The maximum load at which the stone crushes is noted. Crushing strength of the stone per unit area is the maximum load at which its sample crushes or fails divided by the area of the bearing face of the specimen. That is, Crushing Strength of stone = Maximum load at failure _______________________ Area of bearing face 4. Fire resistance test The stone, which is free from calcium carbonate, can resist fire. The presence of calcium carbonate in the stone can be detected by dropping a few drops of dilute sulphuric Acid which will produce bubbles. 5. Electrical Resistance/ Water Absorption Test As the electrical resistance of a wet stone is less, the stone should be non-absorbent. In this test, a stone of known weight is immersed in water for 24 hours. Then, it is weighed again. Percentage absorption of water by weight after 24 hours = (Increase in weight/ Original weight of the stone). 6. Attrition test/Abrasion Test Attrition test is carried out to determine the percentage of wear of stones used for the construction of road. It is carried out in Deval’s Attrition Testing Machine. In this test, some known weight of stone pieces are taken and put in the Deval’s Attrition Test Cylinder. The cylinder is rotated about its horizontal axis at the rate of 30 rpm for 5 hours. Then, the contents of the cylinder are sieved. The quantity of material retained on the sieve is weighted. Percentage Wear = (Loss in Weight/ Initial Weight) × 100. 7. Acid Test In this test, a specimen stone is kept for 1 week in the solution of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid. The corners of stones with high alkaline content turn roundish and loose particles will get deposited on its surface. Such types of stones are unsuitable for smoky atmosphere. 8. Smith’s test This test indicates the presence of earthly matter in the stone. In this test, the sample of the stone is broken into small pieces and put into a test tube containing clear water. The test tube is then shaken vigorously. The directly colour will directly show the presence of argillaceous matter. 9. Crystallization test This test determines the durability or weathering quality of a stone. In this test, a sample of stone is immersed in the solution of sodium sulphate and dried in hot air. The process of wetting and drying is carried out for 2 hours. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.14 The difference in weight, if any, is recorded. Little difference in weight indicates durability and good weathering quality of the stone. 10. Microscopic test This is a Geologist’s test. In this test, the sample of stone is subjected to microscopic examination to study the following properties: • Mineral constitution • Texture of stone • Average grain size • Nature of cementing material • Presence of pores, fissures and veins. 11. Freezing and thawing test In this test, the specimen stone is kept in water for 34 hours. It is then placed in a freezing mixture at –12° C for 24 hours. It is then thawed (warmed) to atmospheric temperature. The procedure is repeated several times and the behaviour of the stone is studied.",

    "text": "By changing the chemical composition and by using different raw materials and additives, many types of cements can be manufactured to cater to the need of the construction industry for specific purposes. Different types of cements are classified as Portland and Non-Portland cement. 1. Rapid-hardening Cement This cement is similar to the ordinary portland cement. As the name suggests, it develops strength rapidly. The rapid rate of strength development is attributed to the higher fineness of grinding. This cement is used where high strength is required instantly in initial stages. For example, repair works, early removal of formwork, etc. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.17 2. Sulphate-resisting Cement Ordinary Portland cement has less resistance to the attacks of sulphates. This type of cement with higher silicate content is effective in fighting back the attacks of sulphates. This is used for the construction of sewage treatment works, marine structures and foundations in soils having large sulphate content. 3. Low-heat Cement This cement hardens slowly but produces less heat than the other cements while reacting with water. This can be used in mass concreting works like construction of dams, etc. 4. Quick-setting Cement This cement sets very quickly. This is due to the reduction of gypsum content in the normal Portland cement. It is used for underwater construction and also for grouting operation. 5. Portland pozzolana Cement Pozzolana is a siliceous material. Portland pozzolana cement is produced by grinding Portland cement clinker and pozzolana with gypsum. It produces less heat of hydration and offers greater resistance to the attack of aggressive water. 6. High-alumina Cement This cement generates high heat while reacting with water and causes high early strength development. So this cement can be used for generating high early strength in cold climates. 7. Air-entraining Cement This cement is produced by mixing a small amount of an air- entraining agent with ordinary Portland cement. By adding this, the properties of concrete can be changed and it also increases the frost resistance of hardened concrete. 8. Masonry Cement This cement has great plasticity, workability and water retentivity as compared with ordinary Portland cement. This is used for masonry constructions in making mortars and plasters. 9. Expansive Cement This cement produces an expansion in concrete during curing. As a result of expansion, cracks due to shrinkage of concrete are avoided. So, this can be used for filling the cracks by grouting and also to overcome cracks formation in reinforced cement concrete structures. 10. Hydrophobic Cement This is a water-repellent cement and is of great utility when the cement has to be stored for longer duration in wet climatic conditions. This cement also improves the workability of concrete. 11. Coloured Cement Coloured cement consists of ordinary portland cement with 5 to 10 per cent of pigment for colouring. This is used for aesthetic purposes. 12. White Cement The colour of this cement is white and it has the same properties of ordinary Portland cement. This can be used for architectural purposes and for manufacturing coloured concrete, flooring tiles, etc. 13. High-strength Cement Certain special works require high strength concrete. To improve the strength a higher content of C3S and higher fineness are incorporated in ordinary Portland cement. This cement can be used for railway sleepers, prestressed concrete, precast concrete and air-field works. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.18",

The above two components of mortar, namely, the binding material and fine aggregate are sometimes referred to as the matrix and adulterant respectively. The matrix binds the particles of the adulterant. The durability, quality and strength of mortar will mainly depend on the quantity and quality of the matrix. The combined effect of the two components of mortar is that the mass is able to bind the bricks or stones firmly.",

Types of Mortars The mortars are classified on the basis of the following: (a) Bulk density (b) Type of binding material (c) Nature of application (d) Special mortars (a) Bulk density According to the bulk density of mortar in dry state, there are the following two types of mortars. (i) Heavy mortars The mortars having bulk density of 15 kN/m3 or more are known as heavy mortars and they are prepared from heavy quartzs or other sands. (ii) Lightweight mortars The mortars having bulk density less than 15 kN/m3 are known as lightweight mortars and they are prepared from light porous sands, pumice and other fine aggregates. (b) type of binding material The type of binding material used for a mortar is according to several factors such as expected working conditions, hardening temperature, moisture conditions, etc. According to the type of binding material, the mortars are classified into the following five categories. (i) Lime mortar In this type of mortar, lime is used as binding material. The lime may be fat lime or hydraulic lime. The fat lime shrinks to a great extent and hence, it requires sand to the extent of about 2 to 3 times its own volume. The lime should be slaked before use. This mortar is unsuitable for water-logged areas or in damp situations. The lime mortar has a high plasticity and it can be placed easily. It possesses good cohesiveness with other surfaces and shrinks very little. It is sufficiently durable, but it hardens slowly. It is generally used for lightly loaded above-ground parts of buildings. (ii) Surkhi mortar This type of mortar is prepared by using only surkhi instead of sand or by replacing half of sand in case of fat lime mortar. The powder of surkhi should be fine Civil Engineering and Materials 3.19 enough to pass BIS No.9 sieve and the residue should not be more than 10 per cent by weight. Surkhi mortar is used for ordinary masonry work of all kinds in foundation and superstructure. But it cannot be used for plastering or pointing since surkhi is likely to disintegrate after some time. (iii) Cement mortar In this type of mortar, cement is used as binding material. Depending upon the strength required and importance of work, the proportion of cement to sand by volume varies from 1:2 to 1:6 or more. It should be noted that surkhi and cinder are not chemically inert substances and hence, they cannot be used as adulterants with matrix as cement. Thus, only sand can be used to form cement mortar. The proportion of cement with respect to sand should be determined with due regards to the specified durability and working conditions. The cement mortar is used where a mortar of high strength and water-resisting properties is required such as underground constructions, water saturated soils, etc. (iv) Gauged mortar To improve the quality of lime mortar and to achieve early strength, cement is sometimes added to it. This process is known as gauging. It makes lime mortar economical, strong and dense. The usual proportion of cement to lime by volume is about 1:6 to 1:8. It is also known as a composite mortar or lime- cement mortar and it can also be formed by the combination of cement and clay. This mortar may be used for bedding and for thick brick walls. (v) Gypsum mortar These mortars are prepared from gypsum binding materials such as building gypsum and anhydrite binding materials. (c) nature of application According to the nature of application, the mortars are classified into the following two categories. (i) Bricklaying mortars The mortars for bricklaying are intended to be used for brickwork and walls. Depending upon the working conditions and type of construction, the composition of masonry mortars with respect to the kind of binding material is decided. (ii) Finishing mortars These mortars include common plastering work and mortars for developing architectural or ornamental effects. The cement or lime is generally used as binding material for ordinary plastering mortar. For decorative finishing, the mortars are composed of suitable materials with due consideration of mobility, water retention, resistance to atmospheric actions, etc. (d) special mortars Following are the various types of special mortars which are used for certain conditions. (i) Fire-resistant mortar This mortar is prepared by adding aluminous cement to the finely crushed powder of fire-bricks. The usual proportion is one part of aluminous cement to two parts of powder of fire-bricks. This mortar is fire-resistant and is therefore used with fire-bricks, for lining furnaces, fire places, ovens, etc. (ii) Lightweight mortar This mortar is prepared by adding materials such as saw dust, wood powder, etc. to the lime mortar or cement mortar. Other materials which may be added are asbestos fibres, jute fibres, coir, etc. This mortar is used for sound-proof and heat- proof construction. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.20 (iii) Packing mortar To pack oil wells, special mortars possessing the properties of high homogeneity, water resistance, predetermined setting time, ability to form solidwater proof plugs in cracks and voids of rocks, resistance to subsoil water pressure, etc. have to be formed. The varieties of packing mortars include cement-sand, cement-loam and cement- sand-loam. The composition of packing mortar is decided by taking into consideration the hydrogeologic conditions, packing methods and type of timbering. (iv) Sound-absorbing mortar To reduce the noise level, the sound-absorbing plaster is formed with the help of sound-absorbing mortar. The bulk density of such a mortar varies from 6 to 12 kN/m3 and the binding materials employed in its composition may be Portland cement, lime, gypsum, slag, etc. The aggregates are selected from lightweight porous materials such as pumice, cinders, etc. (v) X-ray shielding mortar This type of mortar is used for providing the plastering coat to walls and ceiling of X-ray cabinets. It is a heavy type of mortar with bulk density over 22 kN/m3. The aggregates are obtained from heavy rocks and suitable Admixtures are added to enhance the protective property of such a mortar. 3. Properties of Mortar Following are the properties of a good mortar: 1. It should be capable of developing good adhesion with the building units such as bricks, stones, etc. 2. It should be capable of developing the designed stresses. 3. It should be capable of resisting penetration of rain water. 4. It should be cheap. 5. It should be durable. 6. It should be easily workable. 7. It should not affect the durability of materials with which it comes into contact. 8. It should set quickly for speedy construction. 9. The joints formed by mortar should not develop cracks and they should be able to maintain their appearance for a sufficiently long period. 4. Uses of Mortar Following are the uses of mortar: 1. To bind the building units such as bricks, stones, etc. into a solid mass. 2. To carry out pointing and plaster work on exposed surfaces of masonry. 3. To form an even and soft bedding layer for building units. 4. To form joints of pipes. 5. To improve the general appearance of a structure. 6. To prepare moulds for coping, corbles, cornice, etc. 7. To serve as a matrix or cavity to hold coarse aggregates, etc. 8. To distribute uniformly the super incumbent weight from the upper layer to the lower layer of bricks or stones. 9. To hide the open joints of brickwork and stonework. 10. To fill up the cracks detected in the structure during maintenance process, etc. 5. Selection of Mortar Depending upon the nature of civil engineering work, suitable type of mortar should be selected or recommended. Table 3.1 shows the types of mortars to be used for various civil engineering constructions. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.21 table 3.1 Selection of mortars S.No. Nature of work Type of mortar 1.

    "text": "1. Classification of sand According to the nature of source, sand is classified into two groups: (a) Natural Sand (b) Artificial Sand (a) natural sand Is the one which is carried by the river water and is quarried from the river bed, when the river becomes dry. (b) artificial sand Is the one which is the outcome of crushing and breaking stones into different sizes of stone aggregates in a stone crushing plant (or) crushed gravel sand. 2. Qualities of Good Sand  (a) Sand should be clean, hard and durable and preferably dry. (b) It should be free from mica, chemical salts, organic and inorganic impurities and outer foreign matters. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.22 (c) It should preferably be free from, clay, silt and fine dust. In case if the presence of them is unavoidable, they should not be present by more than 5% by weight (or 7% by volume) (d) Sand particles should be well graded and shall have sizes ranging from (150 micron) 0.15 m.m to 4.75 m.m. (e) The fineness modulus of sand shall be from 1.6 to 3.5. 3. Uses of Sand  (a) It is used for making mortar and concrete (b) It is used for filling in the basement of buildings to receive the flooring concrete. (c) It is used as a binding material on the top of bituminous road. (d) It imparts mechanical strength to the mortar and prevents shrinkage and cracking of mortar while setting. (e) It forms major portion of mortar and reduces the cost of mortar. (f) It is mixed with expensive clay soils to stabilise them and prevent cracking of clay soils due to seasonal moisture changes. 4. Tests on Sand The following tests are conducted to find out the suitability of sand. (a) Sieve analysis and fineness modulus test (b) Test for bulkage of sand (c) Test for silt content (a) Sieve analysis and fineness modulus test The sand is sieved through 1. S. Sieves 4.75 mm 2.36 mm., 1.18 mm, 600 micron, 300 micron and 150 micron sieves and percentage retained in each sieve is found out. Fineness modulus of sand = sum of the percentages retained in each sieve divide by 100. Requirement A fineness modulus of 1.6 to 2.0 for sand for plastering mortar and a fineness modulus of 2.5 to 3.5 for sand for concrete and a fineness modulus of 2.0 to 3.0 for sand for masonry mortar may be sufficient. (b) Test for bulkage of sand: bulking of sand The volume of dry sand will increase due to the presence of water in the sand up to about 25% of water content and therafter it will decrease and become equal to its dry volume, when it is saturated with water. This increase in volume of sand is know as bulking of sand. River sand will generally be wet and its volume will be more than the dry volume. Hence, it is necessary to known the bulking of sand to allow for its increase in volume in the volume batching of concrete and mortar. The increase is volume of sand is found out from the test for bulkage of sand. Test for bulkage A small quantity of wet sand is poured into a glass measuring jar and rammed by a small rod of dia 6 mm. and level of sand is noted (say H1). Now water is poured into the cylinder until the sand is submerged and the glass jar is well shaken and Civil Engineering and Materials 3.23 now the level of sand is noted. (say H2). H2 will be less than H1 and sand is saturated when it is submerged. Percentage bulkage of sand = (H1 – H2) _________ H2 × 100 (c) Test of silt content A small quantity of sand is poured into a glass measuring jar. Now water is poured until sand is well submerged in water. The glass jar is now shaken several times so that the silt and dust layer floats at the top of sand layer. The level of sand layer (excluding silt layer) is noted (say H2). The top level of silt layer above sand is noted. (say H1). The percentage of silt by volume = (H1 – H2) _________ H2 × 100",

    "text": "1. Light-weight concrete One of the disadvantages of normal concrete is the high self-weight which has a density of 2200 to 2600 kg/m3. This heavy self-weight causes heavy load and increases the haulage and handling costs. In order to make an economical concrete, attempts were made in the past to reduce the self weight of concrete. As a result the light weight concrete was developed whose density varies from 300–1850 kg/m3. advantages of light-weight concrete (a) It has low density. (b) It has low thermal conductivity. (c) It lowers haulage and handling costs. types of light-weight concrete (a) Light-weight aggregate concrete (b) Aerated concrete (c) No-fine concrete (a) Light-weight aggregate concrete By replacing the usual mineral aggregate by cellular porous or light weight aggregate, light-weight aggregate concrete can be produced. Light- weight aggregate can be classified into two categories namely natural and artificial light- weight aggregate. Natural light-weight aggregates are (i) Pumice (ii) Diatomite Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.26 (iii) Scoria (iv) Volcanic cinders (v) Saw dust (vi) Rice husk Artificial light-weight aggregates are (i) Artificial cinders (ii) Foamed slag (iii) Bloated clay (iv) Sintered flyash (b) Aerated concrete By introducing gas or air bubbles in mortar, aerated concrete can be produced. This concrete is a mixture of water, cement and finely crushed sand with air or gas introducing agents. There are several ways in which aerated concrete can be manufactured. One important way is by the formation of gas or air bubbles using finely powdered metal (usually aluminium powder). Chemical reaction takes place in the concrete and finally large quantity of hydrogen gas is liberated which gives the cellular structure. (c) No-fine concrete By omitting sand fraction from the aggregate, no-fine concrete can be produced. This concrete is made up of only single-sized aggregate of size passing of 20 mm and retained on 10 mm coarse aggregate, cement and water. The single sized aggregate makes a good no-fine concrete, which in addition gives large voids and hence is light in weight. It also offers an architecturally attractive look. Out of the three main groups of light-weight concrete, the light-weight aggregate concrete and aerated concrete are more often used than the no-fine concrete. 2. High-density concrete The concrete whose unit weight ranges from about 3360–3840 kg/m3 and which is about 50 per cent higher than the unit weight of normal concrete is known as high-density concrete. The high-density concrete is mainly used in the construction of radioactive shields. High-density concrete is made by using such a heavy-weight aggregate whose specific gravity is more than 3.5. The aggregates used in this type of concrete should be clean, strong, inert and relatively free from deleterious material. Normally barite, magnetite, lemonite are used to make high-density concrete. To produce high density and high strength concrete, it is necessary to control the water – cement ratio, correct admixture and vibrators for good compaction. 3. Polymer concrete Air voids and water voids are present in the conventional concrete due to improper compaction, high water-cement ratio and some other causes. Due to compaction, these voids are founed and the strength of the concrete is naturally reduced. There are number of methods available to reduce the air voids but none of these methods could really help to reduce the water voids. The impregnation of monomer and subsequent polymerisation is the latest technique adopted to reduce the inherent porosity of the Civil Engineering and Materials 3.27 concrete, to improve the strength and other properties of concrete. This type of concrete is known as polymer concrete. types of polymer concrete 1. Polymer Impregnated Concrete (PIC) 2. Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) 3. Polymer Concrete 4. Partially impregnated and surface coated polymer concrete The following are the monomers normally used in polymer concrete. 1. Methyl melthacrylate (MMA) 2. Styrene 3. Acrylonitrite 4. t-butyl styrene Impregnation of these monomers improves the compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength of concrete and gives the concrete a high freeze thaw resistance and also high resistance to sulphate and acid attack. applications of polymer impregnated concrete 1. Prefabricated structural elements 2. Prestressed concrete 3. Marine works 4. Desalination plants 5. Nuclear power plants 6. Sewage works—pipes and disposal works 7. For water proofing of structures 8. Industrial applications 4. Fibre-reinforced concrete Plain concrete possesses a very low tensile strength, limited ductility and little resistance to cracking. Due to its poor tensile strength, internal microcracks are present in concrete which leads to brittle fracture. To improve the tensile strength of concrete one of the method used is that of the conventional reinforced steel bars and the other way is by introducing fibres in the concrete and thereby increasing the inherent tensile strength of concrete. In order to reduce the microcracks, addition of small, closely spaced and uniformly dispersed fibres are used. These fibres act as crack arrester and substantially improve its static and dynamic properties. This type of concrete is known as Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC). Some of the fibres used are steel fibres. polypropylene, nylons, asbestos, coir, glass and carbon. The property of concrete may vary depending upon the type, diameter, length and volume of fibres. Steel fibre is one of the most commonly used fibre. Most of the times round fibres are used. The diameter of such fibres may vary from 0.25–0.75 mm. The use of steel fibres may improve the flexural, impact and fatigue strength of concrete. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.28 applications of fibre-reinforced concrete Normally, FRC are used in air field, road pavements, industrial floorings, bridge decks, canal lining, explosive resistant structures, refractory linings, etc. It can also be used in pre-cast products like pipes, boats, beams, staircase steps, wall panels, roof panels, manhole covers, etc.",

    "text": "1. Testing of fresh concrete Fresh concrete or plastic concrete is a freshly mixed material which can be moulded into any shape. The most important property of fresh concrete is its workability. Workability The term workability is used to describe the ease or difficulty with which the concrete is handled, transported and placed between the forms with minimum loss of homogeneity. However, this gives a very loose description of this vital property of concrete which also depends on the means of compaction available. For instance, the workability suitable for mass concrete is not necessarily sufficient for thin, inaccessible or heavily reinforced sections. The compaction is achieved either by ramming or vibrating. The workability, as a physical property of concrete alone irrespective of a particular type of construction, can be defined as the amount of useful internal work necessary to produce full compaction. If the concrete mixture is too wet, the coarse aggregates settle at the bottom of the concrete mass and the resulting concrete has a non-uniform composition. On the other hand, if the concrete mixture is too dry, it will be difficult to handle and place it in position. To correlate these two conflicting conditions proportions of various components of concrete mixture should be carefully decided. The important facts in connection with workability are as follows: 1. If more water is added to attain the required degree of workmanship, it results into concrete of low strength and poor durability. 2. If the strength of concrete is not to be affected then, the degree of workability can be obtained in following ways: (i) by slightly changing the proportions of fine and coarse aggregates, in case the concrete mixture is too wet. (ii) by adding a small quantity of water cement paste in the proportion of original mix, in case the concrete mixture is too dry. 3. A concrete mixture for one work may prove to be too stiff or too wet for another work. For instance, stiff concrete mixture will be required in case of vibrated concrete work while wet concrete mixture will be required for thin sections containing reinforcing bars. 4. The workability of concrete is affected mainly by water content, water – cement ratio and aggregate-cement ratio. 5. The workability of concrete is also affected by the grading, shape, texture and maximum size of the coarse aggregates used in the mixture. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.29 In order to measure the workability of concrete mixture, various tests are developed. Tests such as flow test and compaction test are used mostly in laboratory. The slump test, which is commonly used in the field, is briefly described below. It should, however, be remembered that numerous attempts have been made to correlate workability with some easily determinable physical measurement. Although they may provide useful information within a range of variation in workability but none of these tests is fully satisfactory. At the same time, the slump test does not measure the workability of concrete. It is simply useful in detecting variations in the uniformity of a mix of given nominal proportions. slump test",

    "text": "(a) The cone filled with concrete paste (b) The settled paste after the cone is removed . 3.2 is placed on the ground. The operator holds the cone firmly by standing on the foot pieces. The cone is filled with about one- fourth portion and then rammed with a rod which is provided with bullet nose at the lower end. The diameter of the rod is 16 mm and its length is 60 mm. The strokes to be given for ramming vary from 20 to 30. The remaining portion of the cone is filled in with similar layers and then the top of concrete surface is struck off such that the cone is full of concrete. The cone is then gradually raised vertically and removed. The concrete is allowed to subside and then the height of concrete is measured. The slump of concrete is obtained by deducting the height of concrete after subsidence from 30 cm. Table 3.2 shows the recommended slumps of concrete for various types of concrete and Table 3.3 shows the classification of concrete mixes on the basis of slump. 2. Testing of Hardened Concrete 1. Compressive strength It may be defined as the maximum compressive load that can be taken by concrete per unit area. It has been shown that with special care and control, concrete can be made to bear loads as high as 80 N/mm2 or even more. In practice, however, Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.30 concrete with compressive strength between 10–50 N/mm2 can be easily made on the site for common type of construction. table 3.2 Recommended slumps of concrete S.No. Type of concrete Slump 1. Concrete for road construction 20 to 40 mm 2. Concrete for tops of curbs, parapets, piers, slabs and walls that are horizontal 40 to 50 mm 3. Concrete for canal linings 70 to 80 mm 4. Concrete for arch and side walls of tunnels 90 to 100 mm 5. Normal RCC work 80 to 150 mm 6. Mass concrete 25 to 50 mm 7. Concrete to be vibrated 10 to 25 mrn table 3.3 Classification of concrete mixes Slump Nature of concrete mix No slump Stiff and extra stiff mix From 10 to 30 mm Poorly mobile mix From 40 to 150 mm Mobile mix Over 150 mm Cast mix The compressive strength, also called the crushing strength, of concrete is determined by loading axially cube shaped (or cylindrical shaped) specimens made out of the concrete. The tests are carried out 3 days, 7 days and 28 days after the casting of the samples. It is the 28 days compressive strength which is taken as a standard value for concrete of a particular batch. It has been observed that the compressive (crushing) strength of concrete is influenced by a very large number of factors. The most important of these factors are the following: (i) Types of cement The composition, quality and age of the cement used in making concrete influences its strength. Thus, cement that has been stored for considerable time make concrete of lower strength despite all the other factors being the same. Cement with higher proportions of tri-calcium silicates produce concrete that show higher strengths, at least in earlier stages. Similarly, finer the particle size of the cement, higher is the ultimate compressive strength. (ii) Nature of aggregates Sand and coarse aggregates are the other two essential components of concrete. A good bond between cement and the aggregate is possible only when the latter have sharp edges, clean surfaces and rough texture. Smooth and rounded aggregates result in comparatively poor bonds. Similarly, the aggregates used in concrete making should have in themselves, good compressive strength. For example, if chalk (very soft limestone) is used in making concrete instead of massive limestone, the resulting concrete will be weak in compressive strength because of the poor strength of the aggregate. Civil Engineering and Materials 3.31 (iii) Water – cement ratio The compressive strength decreases, in general, with increasing water-cement ratio (other things being the same). Hence, when minimum water just to ensure complete hydration of the cement is used, the resulting concrete will give maximum compressive strength on proper compaction. (iv) Curing conditions Great importance is attached to proper curing of concrete after its laying for obtaining maximum compressive strength. Incomplete curing and intermittent drying of concrete during the curing period may cause a loss in the compressive strength to the extent of 40 per cent or even more. (v) Weather conditions The same concrete placed in different weather conditions like extremely cold, dry and hot, may develop different strength values. The cause is related to incomplete hydration of the cement in the concrete. (vi) Admixtures Certain admixtures are added to the concrete at the mixing stage for some specific purposes. It has been observed that certain admixtures especially calcium chloride, increase the compressive strength. Some other admixtures (e.g. air entraining agents) however, affect the compressive strength adversely if proper controls are not maintained on water-cement ratio. (vii) Methods of preparation Improper mixing of the concrete and careless transport and storing may result in poor strength despite best cement and aggregates used in it. It is the workmanship that determines the quality of the concrete work in ultimate analysis. A skilled worker can produce best concrete works despite some other deficiencies. An incompetent worker, however, may spoil the entire work despite being given the best designed concrete mix. The voids left in the concrete on compaction and curing have a profound influence on the strength of the concrete. 2. Tensile strength Plain concrete (without steel reinforcement) is quite weak in tensile strength which may vary from 1/8 to 1/20 of the ultimate compressive strength. It is primarily for this reason that steel bars (reinforcement) are introduced into the concrete at the laying stage so as to get a concrete which is very strong in compression as well as in tension. In plain concrete, tensile strength depends to a great extent on the same factors as the compressive strength does. Tensile strength of concrete becomes an important property when it is to be used in road making and runways. It is determined by using indirect methods. In one of such methods, it is derived from the flexural strength tests. In these tests, a beam of concrete is cast in standard dimensions depending upon the nominal size of the aggregate. The beam is properly cured and tested after 28 days. It is simply supported from below and equally loaded at its one-third span points from both supports till failure. The bending moments, obviously, induce compressive stresses at the top and tensile stresses at the bottom of beam. The beam fails in tension. Modulus of rupture or flexural strength is then calculated by using the usual beam formula given below: fc = FL ____ bd 2 Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.32 where fc = flexural strength F = maximum applied load L = distance between supports b = breadth d = depth In the second indirect method, called the split cylinder method as shown in . This is termed as splitting tensile strength. The testing machine is adjusted to distribute the load along the entire length of the cylinder. From the load at failure, tensile strength is calculated using the following relationship. ft = 2 P ____ p/d where ft = splitting tensile strength in N/mm2 P = maximum applied load in N l = length of the cylinder (mm) d = diameter of the cylinder (mm) Tension splitting UTM loading plate Plywood piece Steel bar Test sample UTM base plate .33 For approximate use, tensile strength of concrete may be taken between 10–12 per cent of its (cube) compressive strength. 3. Non-destructive tests for concrete Estimation of concrete or member strength is the most common requirement of in-situ investigations but unfortunately, none of the available methods can be used to provide a reliable value in every situation. Non-destructive tests with all their limitations play a vital role in strength determination. Two such test methods normally available are the following: (a) Rebound test method (b) Ultrasonic method (a) rebound test method Rebound test equipment and operation A Swiss engineer, Ernst Schmidt, developed a practicable rebound test hammer in the late 1940s for the first time and modern versions are based on this test. Figure 3.4 shows the basic features of a typical type of hammer which weighs less than two kg. The spring-controlled hammer mass slides on a plunger within a tubular housing. The plunger rotates against a spring when pressed against a concrete surface and this spring is automatically released when tensioned, causing the hammer mass to impact against the concrete through the plunger. When the spring controlled mass rebounds it takes with it a rider which slides along a scale and is visible through a small window in the side of the casing. The rider can be held in position on the scale by depressing the locking button. The equipment is very simple to use. The scale reading is known as the rebound number and is an arbitrary measure as it depends on the energy and the mass used. With this number, the compressive strength of concrete can be obtained from the graph attached with the instrument. Impact spring Concrete surface Window and scale Release catch Hammer guide Rider on guide rod Plunger Hammer mass Housing Locking button Compression spring .34 Procedure The reading is very sensitive to local variations of the concrete, especially aggregate particles close to the surface. It is therefore necessary to take several readings at each test location and to find their average between 9 and 25 readings taken over an area not exceeding 300 mm with the impact points not less than 20 mm from each other or from the edge. The use of grid to locate these points reduce operator bias. The surface must be smooth, clean and dry and properly formed. In case rough surfaces are unavoidable they should be rubbed smooth with carborundum stone. (b) Ultrasonic method In ultrasonic pulse velocity method, the time of travel of an ultrasonic pulse, passing through the concrete to be tested is measured. This is shown in . The pulse generator circuit consists of an electronic circuit for generating pulses and also a transducer which transforms these electronic pulses into mechanical energy having vibration frequencies in the range of 15–50 kHz. The time of travel between initial onset and the reception of the pulse is measured electronically. The path length between transducer when divided by the time of travel, gives the average velocity of wave propagation. With the velocity of wave propagation, the quality and compressive strength of concrete can be obtained as per the classification in Table 3.4.

    "text": "1. Reasons for steel to be considered as a good reinforcing material (i) It develops a good bond with concrete and hence the stresses are transferred from one material to another. (ii) It has high tensile strength. (iii) It has high modulus of elasticity. (iv) Its temperature coefficient of expansion and contraction is same as that of concrete and so thermal stresses do not develop. (v) It is cheap and readily available. 2. Choice of reinforcing steel (a) Reinforcing steel should be chosen such that it can be incorporated in the concrete to form a monolithic structure. (b) The reinforcing steel should be of the smaller section to avoid stress concentration. 3. Forms of reinforcing steel (a) round bars It is a commonly adopted form of reinforcing steel. (b) Flat bars It is more useful in tanks and pipes as they increase effective thickness. (c) square bars (d) reinforcement in the form of fabric It is used in roads, walls and floor slabs where tensile stresses develop more than in one direction. It is more convenient than placing individual bars at right angles to each other. It claims more tensile strength, better bond with concrete, checking of shrinkage and temperature cracks.

Stress-strain curve From the tension test on mild steel, load vs extension or stress-strain diagram is plotted as in . (i) Elastic stage (a to c) Load is increased gradually in the region (a to b) where the stress is directly proportional to strain. That is material obeys Hookes law works up to b which is known as the limit of proportionality. Beyond the limit of proportionality, material ceases to obey Hooke’s law, i.e., the curve falls away from straight line ab produced. However, material remains elastic up to c which is called elastic limit though for all practical purposes b and c are the same. (ii) Yield stage (d to e) Beyond the elastic limit load on the specimen increases with strain till the point d is reached. Beyond d, there is a sudden drop in load from d to e. d is known as upper yield point and e is denoted as lower yield point. Large deformation with no increase in load occurs in ef which is called plastic yielding. (iii) Ductile stage (f to g) Beyond f, the material offers resistance to further straining up to the point g and fg is called ductile stage. (iv) Plastic yielding stage (g to h) Specimen extends almost at constant load. From g to h, the deformation is called plastic yielding, h being ultimate load point where the load is the highest and corresponding stress is called ultimate stress. .40 (v) Load extension stage (hi) Final stage hi occurs very rapidly. In this stage specimen extends under decreasing load. At the breaking point i, the neck forms and it breaks down into two pieces. 2. Properties of mild steel Following are the properties of mild steel. 1. It can be magnetised permanently. 2. It can be readily forged and welded. 3. It cannot be easily hardened and tempered. 4. It has fibrous structure. 5. It is malleable and ductile. 6. It is not easily attacked by salt water. 7. It is tougher and more elastic than wrought-iron. 8. It is used for all types of structural work. 9. It rusts easily and rapidly. 10. Its melting point is about 1400°C. 11. Its specific gravity is 7.80. 12.

    "text": "Timber is a form of wood suitable for building or engineering purposes. It is obtained from trees. All trees are divided into the following two groups based on their mode of growth. (i) Endogenous trees are those which grow by the formation of layers of new wood crossing and penetrating the fibres of the wood previously formed, e.g., bamboo, palmyrah, coconut, etc. (ii) Exogenous trees are those which grow outwards by the addition of rings of young wood, e.g., teak, sal, etc. The cross-section of these trees shows distinct concentric rings, called annual rings. Timbers obtained from the exogenous trees are mainly used in engineering works. Exogenous trees are again sub-divided into (a) Conifers or evergreen trees which yield soft wood, e.g., pine, deodar, etc. (b) Deciduous or broad-leaf trees which yield hard wood, e.g., teak, sal, etc. Timbers used for engineering works are mostly derived from deciduous trees.",

    "text": "The process of reducing the moisture from timber is known as seasoning. Freshly felled tree contains large amount of moisture. If the percentage of moisture is more than 20 per cent then different types of fungus and insects attack the wood. Hence timber needs seasoning. Following methods can be used for seasoning the timber. 1. Natural Seasoning or Air Seasoning In this method, sawn pieces of timber are stacked on stone or brick supports, a little above the ground in layers with sufficient space between them under a shed. They are left this way to get free circulation of air for a long period (two to four years). This is a slow method of seasoning but it is cheap and simple. 2. Water Seasoning In this method, the logs of wood are immersed in water, preferably in the running water of stream or river for two to four weeks. By doing so, sapwood is removed. The logs are then taken out and kept in open air to dry out. Such logs neither warp nor develop cracks but become brittle and their strength is also reduced. 3. Boiling In this method, the timber is either boiled in water or exposed to the action of water for about four hours. It is then taken out and slowly dried. Even though the period of seasoning is less, it is an expensive method. 4. Electrical Seasoning In this method, high frequency alternating current is passed through the timber. The timber gets heated and dries out. This method results in uniform seasoning of wood but the capital cost of equipment needed is more. This method is used in the manufacture of plywood. 5. Chemical Seasoning In this method, green timber is soaked in saturated salt solution, then removed and seasoned in the ordinary way. The interior moisture is drawn out by the saturated salt solution and the timber part dries before the outer one. 6. Kiln Seasoning In this method, the timber is stacked in a chamber or kiln. The chamber is artificially heated to 40° to 90°C by passing hot air in it for three to 12 days. The time and temperature required for seasoning depends on the type of the timber. This is one of the best artificial methods for seasoning wood. By using this method, moisture content in wood can be lowered to a large extent in a shorter period. This method also ensures the availability of well seasoned wood throughout the year.",

    "text": "Most important properties of wood may be discussed under the following general headings. 1. Colour and Odour Most trees are characterised with a typical colour and odour. A freshly cut teakwood has a golden yellow shade. The softwoods like deodar and pine show light (white) colours. As regards to odour (smell), quite a few woods are immediately identified by their characteristic smell. Teak wood has an aromatic smell. 2. Specific Gravity Wood is a very light material, its specific gravity being always less than one (that of water). Woods show good deal of variation in their specific gravity. Some Civil Engineering and Materials 3.45 varieties may be as light as 0.3 whereas in other varieties of timber, the specific gravity may be up to 0.9. This depends on their structure and presence of pores in them. 3. Moisture Content All woods are hygroscopic in nature. They gain moisture from atmosphere. Wood may absorb moisture more than 2–2.5 times than its own weight. A moisture content of 12–15 per cent in air-seasoned woods is considered quite safe for timber being used in any construction. 4. Grain In a normal wood, the tracheids and vessels (collectively called as fibres) grow parallel to the length of the tree trunk. This type of structure is called a straight grain. The fibres may be very tightly and closely packed giving rise to a fibre grained texture in wood. In other cases, they may be broad and quite wider (comparatively). Such a structure is then termed as coarse grained. Sometimes the fibres do not grow essentially parallel to the trunk. These may grow in a twisted, spiral or interlocked manner. Such structure is called cross-grained. 5. Shrinkage and Swelling The newly cut wood loses moisture when made to dry naturally or artificially. On drying, the wood undergoes a shrinkage, Similarly, dry wood on getting rain soaked or wetted may undergo considerable swelling. Thick-walled cells shrink more than the thin walled cells. It is for this reason that the hardwoods shrink more than the softwoods. 6. Strength The most important fact about the strength of timber is that it is not the same in all the directions. The strength of wood is determined with reference to the direction of grain of the wood under load. Besides grain, many other factors also influence the strength of timber. These are (a) density—Higher the density of timber, greater will be its strength. (b) Moisture content—Higher the moisture content, lower is the strength of timber. (c) Presence of defects—There may be a number of natural and artificial defects in timber such as cross-grain, knots and shakes, etc. All of them cause a decrease in the strength of the timber.",

It is possible to shape and reshape these plastics by means of heat and pressure. One important advantage of this variety of plastics is that the scrap obtained from old and worn out articles can be effectively used again. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.48 The following are some of the important thermo plastics. 1. Acrylic Methylmethacrylate is an important constituent of this class of plastics. These are more transparent, rough and strong and do not shudder under impact. It is not affected by moisture and light acids. It is used in place of glass doors and windows and safety glass in automobile and aircrafts. 2. Cellulose acetate They are made from cotton seed and used as electric cables, hand rails, etc. 3. Polythene Transparent, chemically unaffected by moisture and temperature. Used for making pipes, covers for curing of cement and moisture proof packings. 4. Perpex Formed in the shape of sheets which do not break easily. Used as lamp shades, electric fittings and various other building usages. 5. Poly vinyl chloride It is a product obtained from vinyl chlorides and acetate. It resists attacks by acids and alkalis. It is light weight and withstands wear and tear. It is used as drainage pipes, floor-finish, emulsion paints, etc. 3.9.2 thermo-setting Plastics The thermo-setting plastics are the plastics which become rigid when moulded at suitable pressure and temperature. This type of plastic passes originally through thermo plastic stage. Thermo-setting plastics are strong, durable and hard. They are mainly used in engineering applications of plastics. The commonly used thermo-setting plastics are phenol formaldehyde, phenol- furfuraldehide and urea-formaldehyde plastics. Phenol formaldehyde It is formed by heating phenol and benzene in the presence of suitable catalysts. Phenol-furfuraldehyde It is formed by digesting husks of rice, oat, ground-nut with H2S04 distilling the mixture to separate the furaldehyde vapour and allowing the vapours to react with phenol in presence of catalysts. Urea-formaldehyde Urea reacts with formaldehyde in presence of catalysts. These are used for making dishes, drinking glasses, plates, etc. Uses 1. They are used for making plumbing fixtures, fittings and water storage tanks. 2. They are used for making floor and wall tiles. 3. They are used to produce pipes. 4. They are used to form flat sheets used for enclosure panels. 5. Foamed plastics are used for roofing. 6. They are used for doors and windows frames. 7. Plastics are used as an insulating material.

Table 3.6 lists bulk densities of different building materials. (ii) Chemical Resistance The ability of the material to resist against the action of acids, alkalies, gases and salt solution is known as its chemical resistance. Chemical resistance is carefully examined while selecting material for sewer pipes, hydraulic engineering installations, sanitary facilities, etc. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.50 table 3.6 Bulk densities of common building materials S.No. Building materials Bulk density in kN/m3 1.

Steel 78.5 (iii) Coefficient of Softening It is the ratio of compressive strength of material saturated with water to that in dry state. Materials having coefficient of softening more than or equal to 0.8 are referred to as the water-resisting materials. (iv) Density It is defined as the mass per unit volume of the material in its homogeneous state, i.e. neglecting the volume of pores and voids. (v) Density Index The ratio of bulk density of the material to its density is known as its density index. Thus, it denotes the degree to which its volume is filled up with solid matter. Density index for most of the building materials is less than unity. (vi) Durability The property of a material to resist the combined action of atmospheric and other factors is known as its durability. The life and maintenance cost of any structure depends upon the durability of the materials which it is composed of. (vii) Porosity The degree by which the volume of material is occupied by pores is termed as porosity. It is the ratio of volume of voids to the total volume of the specimen. (viii) Specific Heat The term specific heat indicates the quantity of heat (expressed in kilocalories) required to heat one N of material by one degree centigrade. (ix) Thermal Conductivity Thermal conductivity of a material is defined as the amount of heat in kilocalories, that will flow through a unit area of the material with unit thickness in unit time and when the difference of temperature on its faces is also unity. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity of a material is termed as its thermal resistivity. (x) Thermal Capacity The property by which the material absorbs heat is termed as its thermal capacity.

(i) Abrasion (ii) Elasticity (iii) Plasticity (iv) Strength (v) Impact strength (vi) Wear (vii) Fatigue (viii) Hardness (ix) Brittleness (x) Ductility (xi) Malleability (xii) Toughness (i) abrasion It is the property of a material by which it resists the action of moving load. It is found by dividing the difference in weights of the specimen, before and after abrasion with the area of abrasion. (ii) elasticity The property by which a material regains its original shape and position after the removal of external load is known as elasticity. (iii) Plasticity It is the property of a material, by which no deformation vanishes, when it is relieved from the external load. (iv) strength The ability of a material to resist failure under the action of external load is known as its strength. The loads to which a material is commonly subjected to are compression, tension and bending. The corresponding strength is obtained by dividing the ultimate load with the cross-sectional area of the specimen. (v) impact strength It is defined as the quantity of work required to cause failure per unit of its volume. Thus, the impact strength indicates the toughness of the material. (vi) Wear The failure of a material under the combined actions of abrasion and impact is known as its wear. It is usually expressed as a percentage of loss in weight and it is very important to decide the suitability of a material for use of road surfaces, railway ballast, etc. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 3.52 (vii) Fatigue When the materials are subjected to repetitive fluctuating stress, they will fail at a stress much lower than that required to cause fracture under steady loads. This property is known as fatigue. (viii) Hardness It is the ability of a material to resist penetration by a harder body. It plays an important role in deciding the workability and use of a material for floors and road surfaces. For stone materials, hardness can be determined with the help of Mohr’s scale of hardness. It is a list of ten materials arranged in the order of increasing hardness as shown in Table 3.7. The level of hardness of a material lies between the hardnesses of two materials, i.e. the one which scratches and the other which is scratched by the material to be tested. (ix) Brittleness A material is said to be brittle when it cannot be drawn into a wire by tension. A brittle material fails suddenly under pressure without appreciable deformation preceding the failure. Concrete, glass, cast-iron, rock materials, etc. are some of the examples of brittle materials. (x) ductility It is a property of a material by which it can be drawn into a wire by tension. (xi) Malleability The property by which a material can be uniformly extended in a direction without rupture is known as malleability. This property finds its applications in many operations such as forging, hot rolling, etc. (xii) toughness Toughness is the property of a material that enables it to absorb energy without fracture. This property is useful in shock loading. table 3.7 S.No. Material Remarks 1. Talcum Readily scratched by finger nail 2. Rock-salt or gypsum Scratched by finger nail 3.

    "text": "With the knowledge of the properties and uses of various construction materials, the next step is to study about the actual construction procedure. The first and foremost job in construction is to select a suitable site for the building. A properly selected site of the building gives enhanced beauty to the building without any extra expenditure. The following points should be considered while selecting the site for any particular building: 1. Soil at the building site should not be of artificially made-up type. Buildings constructed over such soils normally undergo differential settlement and cracks are quite common in such buildings. 2. The site should not be undulating since this leads to increase in cost for levelling the ground. 3. The site should have its general slope, sloping away from the site in order to enable easy drainage of the building. 4. Civic services, such as main water supply mains, electric lines, telephone lines, drainage sewers, should be near the site so that no additional costs are incurred. 5. The groundwater table in the site should not be high. 6. Type of the building also affects the site selection. For example, industrial buildings should be situated outside the city, residential buildings must be near schools and hospitals, and public buildings should be located in open areas so that all the requirements may be fulfilled. 7. The selected site should be as far as possible large enough to provide sufficient light and air to the building. 8. The building site should not be in a depression since this will cause drainage problems as well as affect the aesthetic appearance. 9. If the site is sloping, it should be rising towards the back. This improves the elevation and also gives the feeling of comfort. On sloping sites, planning with Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 4.2 differential floors becomes possible. The garage and the miscellaneous utilities can be accommodated in the basement. 10. The site should be connected with good communication lines such as good system of roads and railways. 11. The site should possess good soil at reasonable depths so that the foundation cost is reduced. 12. The selected site should be adequate to accommodate all the essential accessories required in the building. 13. Residential buildings should not be located near workshops and factories since such locations are subjected to continuous noise. 14. A site along seashore is good from the entertainment point of view but sea breeze being damp affects health. Metallic fittings are liable to corrode here. 15. The topographical features of the site with natural and artificial surroundings affect the selection of site to great extent. For instance, in a region of the city having large buildings, a small residential building may not be aesthetically appealing. 16. For industrial buildings, the site selected should be such that (a) all the raw materials required for the industry must be available nearby (b) the labourers should be available from the nearby areas (c) the site must have enough space for future expansion, of industry, for the construction of residential areas for workers, etc. (d) suitable disposal plant to treat the solid or liquid wastes produced by the industry must be available at reasonable distance 17. Climate plays an important role in selecting sites for industrial buildings. For example, a cool and moist weather is more favourable for weaving and textile mills.",

    "text": "The purpose of soil classification is to arrange various types of soils into groups according to their various engineering properties. For civil engineering purposes, soils may be classified by the following systems: 1. Particle size classification 2. IS classification system and unified soil classification 3. Textural classification 1. Particle size classification In this system, soils are classified according to the grain size. To indicate grain sizes, terms such as boulder, cobble, gravel, sand, silt and clay are used. The grain size of the various types of soils is given in Table 4.1. 2. IS classification system and unified soil classification This system is based on both grain size and plasticity properties of the soil and is therefore applicable to any engineering use. In this system of classification, soils are broadly divided into the following three categories. (i) Coarse-grained soils (ii) Fine-grained soils (iii) Highly organic soils Table 4.1 Grain size of various types of soils S.No. Soil Grain-size 1. Boulder Greater than 300 mm 2. Cobble 80 mm–300 mm 3. Gravel 4.75 mm–80 mm 1. Fine gravel 4.75 mm–20 mm 2. Coarse gravel 20 mm–80 mm 4. Sand 0.075 mm–4.75 mm 1. Fine sand 0.075 mm–0.425 mm 2. Medium sand 0.425 mm–2.0 mm 3. Coarse sand 2.0 mm– 4.75 mm 5. Silt 0.002 mm–0.075 mm 6. Clay Less than 0.002 mm Foundation 4.5 (i) Coarse-grained soils In these soils, more than half the total material by mass is larger than 0.075 mm IS sieve size. They are further divided into the following two subdivisions. (a) Gravel (b) Sand (ii) Fine-grained soils In these soils, more than half the material by mass is smaller than 0.075 mm IS sieve size. They are further divided into the following three subdivisions. (a) Inorganic silts and very fine sands (b) Inorganic clays (c) Organic silts and clays and organic matter (iii) Highly organic soils These soils contain large percentages of fibrous organic matter, such as peat and the particles of decomposed vegetation. In addition, certain soils containing shells, concretions, cinders and other non-soil materials in sufficient quantities are also grouped in this division. 3. Textural classification Classification of composite soils based on the particle size distribution is known as textural classification. This classification is based on the percentages of sand, silt and clay sizes making up the soil. Such a classification is more suitable to describe coarse- grained soils rather than clay soils whose properties are less dependent on the particle size distribution. Probably the best known of these textural classifications is the triangular classification of US Public Roads Administrations shown in . In the figure for the given percentages of the three constituents forming a type of soil, lines are drawn parallel to the three sides of the equilateral triangle, as shown by arrows in the chart. For example, if a soil is composed of 20 per cent sand, 20 per cent silt and 60 per cent clay, the three lines drawn accordingly intersect in the zone marked for clay. Hence, such a soil will be termed clay. 100 10 30 50 70 90 10 30 50 70 90 80 60 40 20 0 Sand sizes % Clay sizes % Silt sizes % Loam Silty Clay Sand Sandy Loam Silty Loam Silty clay loam Clay Sandy Clay Sandy clay loam Clay loam .6",

    "text": "This term is used to indicate the maximum load per unit area which the soil will resist safely without displacement. By dividing the ultimate bearing power of soil by a factor of safety, the safe bearing capacity is obtained. On completion of a structure, there may be some displacement in the position of the foundation. For ordinary framed structures of concrete, the permissible angular distortion is 1/500 and the desirable value is 1/1000. The maximum differential settlement should not exceed 25 mm in case of foundations on sandy soil and 40 mm in case of foundations on clayey soil. In case of non-cohesive soils, such as sand and gravel, the allowable bearing capacity should be reduced by 50 per cent, provided that the water table is above or near the bearing surface of the soil. The bearing capacity of reclaimed soils or shrinkable soils can be taken as 50 kN/m2 in the absence of the site data. The bearing capacity of the soil can be found by loading the soil, noting the settlement and by dividing the maximum load by the area on which the load is applied.

    "text": "When the depth of the foundation is less than or equal to its width, it is defined as a shallow foundation. The two main types of shallow foundation discussed in this section are the isolated footing and the combined footing. The various types of shallow foundations are • Isolated column footing • Wall footing • Combined footing Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 4.8 • Cantilever footing • Continuous footing • Inverted arch footing • Grillage foundation • Raft or Mat foundation • Stepped Foundation 1. Isolated Footing  In framed structures where several columns are to be constructed, isolated footings can be adopted. The columns involved can be provided with masonry or concrete footing. If masonry footing is provided, steps are given and the foundation area is thus increased so that the stresses developed at the base are within the limit. Concrete can be moulded to any shape and hence a concrete footing may be a sloping one to provide sufficient spread. In case of masonry footing, the projection of each step must be 1/2 brick thick and each step is made of 1 or 2 bricks put together. Masonry footing and RCC footing are shown in . Isolated footing is provided under a column to transfer the load safely to the soil bed. If the column is loaded lightly, a spread is given under the base of the column. This spread is known as footing. For heavily loaded column, the total width of the footing may be very high. This is attained in three or four steps and is called stepped footing. If the total width of the footing is attained by gradually increasing the width towards the bottom, then it is called sloped footing. . Wall Footing  If the footing is provided throughout the length of the wall in the case of load-bearing walls, then it is called wall footing. Wall footings can be either simple or stepped. Foundation 4.9 Depth of footing The minimum depth of footing is given by the Rankine’s formula as, D = P/W ( 1– sin j 2 _________ 1 + sin j  ) where, D = minimum depth of footing P = safe bearing capacity of soil in kg/m2 W = unit weight of soil in kg/m3 j = angle of repose of soil in degrees The minimum depth of footing for the load bearing wall is limited to 90 cm for the stability. Width of footing It is obtained by dividing the load including dead load, live load and wind load etc. by the allowable bearing capacity of the soil. B = T/P where, B = Width of footing in metre T = Total load per metre run in kg P = Safe bearing capacity of the soil in kg/m2 3. Combined Footing This type of footing is adopted when the space between two columns is so small that the foundation for individual columns will overlap. Combined footings are proportioned in such a way that the centre of gravity of the loads coincides with the centre of gravity of .C.C. footing .10 the foundation. Hence these footings have either a trapezoidal or a rectangular shape. The plan of a combined footing is shown in . Column Footing Plan . The shape of the combined footing is proportional in such a way that the centre of gravity of the resultant area is in the same vertical line as the centre of gravity of the loads. Generally, the shape of the footing is rectangular or trapezoidal as shown in . . Strip Footing Strip footing is one of the different types of shallow foundation. This is used where soil of good bearing capacity is available at a depth of less than 3 m from the ground level. Since the footing is provided throughout the length of the wall in case of load bearing walls, it is also called as wall footing. Strip footings are classified as follows: 1. simple footing Simple footings are provided in case of walls of very light structures like residential buildings. In simple footing, cement or lime concrete is used in foundation. Foundation 4.11 The projection beyond the face of the wall (offset) of the concrete base is 15 cm on either side as shown in .",

Cantilever Footing Cantilever footing consists of an eccentric footing for the exterior column and a concentric footing for the interior column and they are connected by a strap or a cantilever beam. Such footings are used when it is not possible to place a footing directly below a column because of limitations of boundary or eccentric loading conditions. The load from the exterior column is balanced by a load of the interior column acting about a fulcrum. 6. Continuous Footing In this type of footing, a single continuous RC slab is provided as foundation for three or more columns in a row. This type of footing is more suitable to prevent the differential settlement in the structure and for the safety against earthquake. . 4.9 Cantilever footing Foundation 4.13 7. Inverted Arch Footing In this type of footing, inverted arches are constructed between two walls at the base. It is suitable for soils of low bearing capacity and when the depth of the foundation is to be kept less. The end columns must be strong enough to resist the outward pressure caused by such action. This type of foundation is suitable for bridges, sensors, tanks, etc. 8. Grillage Foundations Grillage foundation is used to transfer the heavy structural loads from steel columns to a soil having low bearing capacity. It is constructed by rolled steel joists (RSJ) which are placed in single or double tier. In double-tier grillage, the top tier is placed at right angles to the bottom tier. The distance between the flanges of RSJ should be equal to 1.5 to 2.0 times the width of the flange or 30 cm whichever is smaller. The steel joists of the grillage are kept in position by pipe separators and nuts. The whole arrangement of the rolled steel joists is completely embedded in concrete. The concrete filling is not supposed to take any load but it keeps the steel joists in position and prevents them from corrosion. The bed of concrete should have a minimum depth of 15 cm. A grillage foundation may be constructed for a single column or for more than one column. . Raft Foundation or Mat Foundation  When the load of the structure is very heavy and the bearing capacity of the soil is very low then raft foundation is adopted.

Due to low bearing capacity, large isolated footings are Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 4.14 necessary to support the structure. If the sum of the base areas of the footings required to support a structure exceeds about half the total building area then it is preferable to combine the footings into a single raft.

    "text": "1. Pile foundation Pile is an element of construction used as foundation. It may be driven in the ground vertically or with some inclination to transfer the load safely. Loads are supported in two ways, i.e., either by the effect of friction between the soil and the pile skin or by resting the pile on a very hard stratum. The former is called friction the pile and the latter one is the load bearing pile. Friction piles may be made of cast iron, cement, concrete, timber, steel, wrought iron and composite materials. Load bearing piles are steel sheet piles, concrete piles and timber piles. Piles may be cast-in-situ or precast. They may be cased or uncased. 2. Under-reamed piles Structures built on expansive soils often crack due to the differential movement caused by Foundation 4.15 the alternate swelling and shrinking of soil. Under-reamed piles provide a satisfactory solution to the above problem. Figure 4.13 shows the details of an under-reamed pile. The principle of this type of foundation is to transfer the load to a hard strata which has sufficient bearing capacity to take the load. Single and double under-reamed piles may also be provided for foundations- of structures in poor soils overlying firm soil strata. In such soils if double under-reamed piles are provided, both the under-reams shall rest within the firm soil strata. 3. Timber pile In this type, trunks of trees are used as piles. The wood should be free from any defect. These piles may be circular or square. The dimension varies from 30 cm to 50 cm. The length of a timber pile should not exceed 20 times its top width to avoid bulking. At the bottom of the pile, an iron shoe is provided and at the top a steel plate is fixed. 4. Composite piles These piles are made up of two portions of different materials driven one above the other. Common types of composite piles in use are 1. Timber and concrete 2. Steel and concrete In the timber and concrete composite pile, the timber portion is used below the lowest level of the ground water table, and the concrete piles, usually cast-in-situ, is formed above it. This combination gives the twin advantage of durability of concrete piles and the cheapness of timber piles. In steel and concrete composite piles a steel piles, or H pile is attached to the lower end of concrete pile. 5. Steel pile Steel piles are made in three forms: rolled steel H-section piles, box piles and tube piles. There can be no restriction on length due to high strength. However, steel piles may be affected by corrosive agents like salt, moisture, acid or oxygen. To prevent the steel pile from corrosion, its thickness may be increased or encased in concrete or chemical coating with paint is applied. See . In this, H-Section pile having wide flanges is used. The pile projects slightly above the ground level and foundations as a column. Due to its small cross section, it can be driven into the soil easily. . 4.15 Composite pile Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 4.16 A box pile is rectangular or octagonal. It is filled with concrete. When an H-Section pile is difficult to be driven, a box pile is preferred.",

Stretcher This is a brick laid with its length parallel to the face or direction of a wall. A layer of bricks containing stretchers is called a stretcher course. Header This is a brick laid with its breadth or width parallel to the face or direction of a wall. A course (layer of bricks) containing headers is a header course. Bed joint The horizontal layer of mortar upon which bricks are laid is called a bed joint. Perpends The vertical joints either in the length or in the cross directions are known as perpends. For a good bond, the perpends in alternate layers should be one above the other. Lap The horizontal distance between the vertical joints in two successive courses is termed as lap. Superstructure 5.3 Closer A piece of brick that is used to close up the bond at the end of brick courses is known as a closer. It helps preventing the vertical joints of successive courses coming one over the other. The types of closer are the following: 1. Queen closer This is obtained by cutting the brick longitudinally into two equal parts. This is generally placed near the quoin header to obtain necessary lap. 2. King closer This is obtained by cutting a triangular portion of the brick such that half a header and half a stretcher are obtained on the adjoining cut faces. A king closer is used near door and window openings to get satisfactory arrangement of mortar joints. 3. Bevelled closer This is obtained by cutting a triangular portion of half the width but of full length of the brick. This is used for splayed brick work. 4. Mitred closer This is obtained by cutting a triangular portion of the brick through its width and making an angle of 45–60° with the length of the brick. It is used at corners, junctions etc. Bat This is a piece of brick cut parallel to its width so as to form half or three quarter of a brick known as half bat or three-quarter bat. Bullnose A brick moulded with a rounded angle is termed as a bullnose and it is used for a rounded quoin. Cownose A brick moulded with a double bullnose on end is termed as a cow nose. Squint quoin A brick which is cut or moulded in such a way that an angle other than right angle is formed in the plan is known as squint quoin.",

    "text": "A bond is an arrangement of layers of bricks by which no continuous vertical joints are formed. Bricks can be arranged in various forms. The following are the types of bonds in brick work: 1. Stretcher bond All the bricks are arranged in stretcher courses. The stretcher bond is useful for one-brick partition walls as there are no headers in such walls. As the internal bond is not proper, this is not used for walls of thickness greater than one brick. A stretcher bond is shown in . 2. Header bond In this type, all the bricks are arranged in header courses. It is used for curved surfaces since the length will be less. If a stretcher bond is used in a curved surface, it will project beyond the face of the wall. Figure 5.3 shows a header bond. . 5.3 Header bond Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.4 3. English bond (a) One-brick wall Plan of stretcher course Queen closer Queen closer Plan of header course Elevation-English bond . It is the strongest type of bond. It is used for all wall thicknesses. (a) Alternate Courses English bond consists of headers and stretchers in alternate courses in elevation. (b) Queen Closer A queen closer is placed next to the quoin header, in each header course to the full thickness of the wall. This is done to break the continuity of the vertical joints in the successive courses. Thus, a lap joint is provided to create the bond. (c) Alternative Header Each alternative header lies centrally over a stretcher of the stretcher course. (d) Wall Thickness in Even Number of Half-Bricks If the wall thickness is an even number of half-bricks, the same course will show either headers or stretchers on both the face and back. That is, the appearance on both face and back are the same. (e) Wall Thickness in Odd Number of Half-Bricks If the wall thickness is an odd number of half-bricks, the same course will show headers of the face and stretchers on the back or stretchers on the face and headers on the back of the wall. (f) Continuous Vertical Joints Continuous vertical joints should not be allowed except at the stopped end. (g) Wall Thickness of Two Bricks or More For walls of thickness of two bricks or more, the interior or hearting of these thicker walls should be filled with headers only. Superstructure 5.5 (h) Thinner Header Course There are more vertical joints in the header course than in stretcher course. Hence, the joints in the header course should be thinner than in the stretcher course. (b) One-and-a-half brick wall In English bond, stretcher and header courses are laid alternately in the facing of the wall. In this, the queen closer is placed next to the quoin header to break the continuity of the vertical joints. Each alternate header is centrally placed over a stretcher. If the thickness of the wall is an even number of half brick, the wall presents the same appearance on both the faces, otherwise the same course will present stretchers on one face and header on the other (. Perspective view Top view . Flemish bond In this type of bond, the headers are distributed evenly as shown in . The peculiarities of a Flemish bond are as follows: (a) In every course headers and stretchers are placed alternately. (b) The queen closer is put next to the queen header in alternate courses to develop the lap. (c) Every header is centrally supported over a stretcher below it. (d) The Flemish bond may be either a double Flemish bond or a single Flemish bond. In a double Flemish bond, headers and stretchers are placed alternately in front as well as in rear elevations. For this type of bond, if the wall thickness is equal to an odd multiple of half bricks, then half bats and three quarter bats have to be used. For walls of thickness equal to even number of half bricks, no bats will be required. A stretcher or a header in the front elevation will appear as a stretcher or header in the rear elevation also. This has a better appearance than the English bond but not so strong as the English bond. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.6 A single Flemish bond consists of a Flemish bond in the front and an English bond in the rear along with the filling. This type of bond is used when expensive bricks are used for the front and requires a minimum wall thickness of 1/2 bricks. (e) As in the English bond, the bricks in the same course do not break the joints with each other and the joints are straight. (f) In this bond, short continuous vertical joints are formed. (g) Brick bats are to be used for walls having a thickness equal to uneven multiple of half bricks. Comparison of English Bond and Flemish Bond Sl.No Aspects English Bond Flemish Bond 1. Strength and wall Strength is more, for walls Strength is more, for walls of 1 brick thickness of thickness 1½ bricks or more thickness; for thicker wall, strength is less 2.

Mortar Less mortar is used More mortar is required Elevation Plan-first course Back Face Queen closer Back Face Queen closer Plan-second course .7 5. Raking Bonds In this type of bond, the bonding bricks are kept at an inclination to the direction of the wall. The raking course is generally provided between the two stretcher courses. This bond is used in thick walls. Raking bonds are two types: 1. Diagonal bond 2. Herringbone bond . These are of the following two types: 1. Diagonal bond See . In this bond, bricks are laid diagonally. Internal placing of bricks is made in one direction only at certain angle of inclination, after face bricks are laid. The angle selected is to ensure minimum breaking of bricks. 2. Herringbone bond In this bond, the bricks are laid at an angle of 450 from the centre in both the directions. 6. Zig-Zag Bond See . In the bond, the bricks are laid zig-zag. This method is used for paving or making ornamental finish in the brick floor. Bricks cut to triangular shapes and of suitable size are packed in the small triangular spaces at the ends. Garden Wall Bond This type of bond is used for the construction of garden walls, boundary walls, compound walls, where the thickness of the wall is one brick and the height does not exceed two meters. Garden wall bonds are two types: (i) Garden wall English Bond In this bond, the header course is provided only after three to five stretcher courses. (ii) Garden wall Flemish bond In this bond, each course contains one header after three to five stretchers continuously placed throughout the length of the course. .8",

    "text": "In order to make a brick masonry wall safe, its thickness must be sufficient enough to withstand the loads coming on it. The loads acting on a wall are dead loads, live loads, and wind loads. The vertical loads may be concentric or eccentric. The tendency of the wall to overturn due to the effect of wind pressure depends on the overall height of the wall. The distance between the top of floor concrete and the highest part of the wall is the overall height. The height of a floor is also important while designing a wall. For domestic buildings, the floor height may be 3-4 m. The length of the wall is fixed on the basis of its tendency to buckle laterally. Its thickness also depends on the strength of bricks as well as the strength of cement mortar. 5.2.4 points to be Observed while Supervising the Construction of Brick Work 1. The bricks to be used should conform with the requirements of the specification of the work. 2. The bricks should be saturated with water so as to prevent absorption of moisture from the mortar. 3. Bricks should be laid with the frog located uppermost and the mortar should completely cover the bed. 4. Brick work should be carried out in a proper bond. 5. The mortar to be used should be of good quality. 6. The brick work should be raised uniformly. 7. In brick work, brick bats should not be used except as closers. All brick bats of size less than half brick should be rejected. 8. Single scaffolding should be adopted to carry out brick work at higher levels. 9. The vertical faces should be checked with a plumb bob and the inclined faces should be checked with the templates. 10. After construction, brick work should be well watered for a period of about two to three weeks if lime mortar is used and for about one to two weeks if cement mortar is used. Superstructure 5.9",

Effect of deflection and shrinkage of the concrete slabs resting on walls. 3. Development of internal forces due to moisture absorption, temperature variations, etc. The measures to prevent cracking in masonry walls are given below: 1. The foundation supporting masonry walls should be designed with sufficient stiffness. 2. The provision of horizontal and vertical expansion joints in the walls helps in reducing the occurrence of cracks. 3. The usage of concrete with low shrinkage characteristics also prevents cracking. 4. It is preferable to have short spans for the floor slabs.",

    "text": "Stone is a natural choice for masonry, where it is available in plenty. Its durability has been demonstrated in our temples and massive structures. Coal tar, paraffin, linseed oil or solution of alum and soap are the preservatives used to prevent the stone from the effects of rain water, wind, etc. Stone masonry is the construction carried out using stones with mortar. But, because of high cost of transportation, painful and costly work of dressing and the need for experienced labour, stone masonry is presently not popular. Further, stone-masonry walls occupy more space compared to brick-masonry walls. Types of Stones Types of stones used in stone masonry are • Dense stones like granites and quartzite • Fire-resistant stones and sandstones • Soft stones like limestone, marble and slate used for carvings, arches, etc. Uses of Stone Masonry • Foundation, floor, walls, lintels, columns, roofs, etc. • Walls, roofs, lintels for temples, monuments, etc. • For facing works in brick masonry to give massive appearance Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.10 5.3.1 Dressing of Stones After quarrying, stones are to be dressed for surface finish. Dressing of stones is the art of cutting the stones to the shape required for use in the structures. It is done at the quarry itself. Quarry dressing has the following advantages in comparison to sit dressing: • Cheap labour is available at the quarry site. • Freshly quarried stones contain some moisture called quarry sap. Hence, they are comparatively soft and can be easily dressed. • It is possible to sort out the stones at the quarry for different works. Irregular and rough portions of the stones can be removed then and there in the quarry. Thus, the weights of the stones as well as transportation of stones are reduced. Tools used for dressing of stones Hammers Mason hammer, scrabbling hammer, mash hammer, waller’s hammer, spalling hammer, fare hammer Chisels Crow chisel, soft stone chisel, draught chisel, plain chisel, splitting chisel, punch chisel and point chisel Axes Punching machine Types of dressing Stones for different types of stone masonry are dressed as follows: 1. Hammer Dressing For rubble masonry, stones are roughly dressed with hammers. The surface thus obtained is called hammer-dressed. The stones are made roughly square or rectangular or polygonal using a waller’s hammer. The exposed face of the stone may be roughly shaped by using a mash hammer. The lower and upper surfaces of the stones are almost dressed flat. 2. Chisel Dressing For good Ashlar masonry, the faces of stones are finely dressed by means of chisels. A draught chisel is sunk round the margin of the stone. Its front face is dressed to rock face. Sometimes, to make the entire face truly smooth, chisel draughts are sunk diagonally on the stone face and the intermediate portions are brought down to a level with the help of dressing tools. At length, the chisel marks are removed by rubbing the surface with a stone slab and fine sand. 3. Axed Finish Axed Finish is employed in hard stones like granites. An axe is used for the dressing operation. 4. Polished Finish Granite, marble and trap take a good polish. This is achieved manually or by the aid of polishing machines. Superstructure 5.11",

    "text": "The technical terms in stone masonry are illustrated in . Natural bed The surface on which the materials were originally deposited in the formation of rock is known as natural bed. Rocks, from which stones for masonry are obtained, have distinct planes of division along which stone can easily be split. These planes are the natural beds of the stone. Plinth Plinth is the projecting course at the ground-floor level. It is used to indicate the height of ground-floor level from ground level. The plinth course protects the interior of a building from rain water, frost, etc., Course Course is a layer of stones (or bricks). The thickness of a course is equal to the thickness of a stone (or brick) plus the thickness of one mortar joint. String course String course is a continuous horizontal course of masonry, provided at every floor level. This course remains projecting from the face of the wall. It is intended to improve the elevation of the structure. Lacing course Lacing course is a horizontal course provided to strengthen a wall of regular small stones. Quoins Quoins is the external coners or angle of a wall surface. The stone or brick used to form the quoin is known as quoin stone or quoin brick. Spalls Spalls are stone chips broken off from large-sized stones during dressing and shaping. Bed joint It is the horizontal joint between two consecutive courses of stone masonry. Corbel Corbel is a stone piece provided in a wall. It projects partly outside. The projecting stone surface acts as bearing for the structureal member such as beam, roof truss, wall plates, etc., resting on it. Pin header Pin header is a long stone provided vertically in the stone masonry. It ensures a bond between successive courses. .12 Cornice Cornice is a moulded course of stone masonry. It is placed at the top of a wall or ceiling near the top of the building. Sill Sill is the bottom surface of a door or a window opening. Coping Coping is a course of stone, concrete or brick placed on the exposed top of parapet wall or compound wall. It protacts the wall from seepage of rainwater through joints at the topmost course of the wall. A coping is suitable weathered and throated. Throating Throating is a small groove cut on the underside of a still, coping, cornice or sunshade. It is provided to discharge rainwater without trickling down to thw walls. Weathering Weathering is a slope provided to the top surface of stones used for coping, cornice and still to drain off the water immediately. Through stone or bond stones In stone masonry, some long stones at regular intervals are placed through the full thickness of a wall to develop bond. Such stones are known as through stones or bond stones. Jambs Jambs are the vertical sides of the openings of masonry for doors, windows, etc Jambs may be plain or splayed or may be provided with the recess to receive the frames of doors and windows. Reveals Reveals are the exposed vertical surfaces left on the sides of an opening after the door or window frame is fitted in position. Hearting Hearting is a filled-up core of a rubble wall. Lintels or heads Lintels are the horizontal stones provided at the top of the openings for doors, windows, etc. Cramp Cramp is a metal connection used in stone masonry construction.",

    "text": "Stone masonry is classified based on the thickness of joints, continuity of courses and finish of face. The two broad classifications are given below: 1. Rubble Masonry 2. Ashlar Masonry (i) Random rubble masonry (i) Ashlar fine masonry un-coursed and coursed (ii) Ashlar rough–tooled masonry (ii) Squared rubble masonry (iii) Ashlar rock or quarry faced un-coursed and coursed masonry (iii) Polygonal rubble masonry (iv) Ashlar chamfered masonry (v) Ashlar facing masonry 1. Rubble Masonry A rubble stone masonry wall is made up of irregular sizes and shapes. The stones obtained from the quarry are broken into small sizes and are directly used in the construction work. Superstructure 5.13 In some cases, these stones may be shaped to suit the requirement, with the help of hammers just by removing excess projections. These stones have rounded natural face or angular faces or angular broken pieces. Rubble masonry is further classified into three types. They are explained below. (i) Random Rubble Masonry Random rubble masonry uses stones of irregular shapes. The stones are arranged in a random fashion. The joints are pointes to achieve a good appearance. The efficiency of this type depends on the workmanship of the stone mason. Random rubble masonry may be either uncoursed or coursed as explained below. (a) Uncoursed Random Rubble Masonry See . It is the cheapest type of stone masonry. Stone blocks are njot dressed, but used in the masonry as obtained from the quarry. They are of varying sizes and placed in irregular pattern. The vertical joints are not constructed in plumb. So, no regular courses are achieved. Larger stones are used at the bed level and in the corners. However, at 30 cm to 60 cm height intervals, the stones may be leveled. Spaces between larger stones are filled with spalls (small stones of irregular sizes) and packed in mortar. Bond stones are used at random intervals. The appearance is not very pleasing. Uses It is used for compound walls, godowns and walls of unimportant structures. (b) Coursed Random Rubble Masonry See . In Coursed Random Rubble Masonry, stones of 5 to 20 cm size are used. Stones are hammer dressed. Stones of equal height are used in every course of the stone masonry. Thus, masonry work is carried out in courses. The stones are arranged such that the vertical joints of two adjacent courses do not coincide. Through Stones are used at every 2 meter distance in each course to form bond. Uses: This type of masonry is used for residential buildings, industrial buildings, compound walls, werehouses, etc. (ii) Squared Rubble Masonry In squared rubble masonry, the stones are roughly squared with straight edges and sides with hammer blows. (a) Un-coursed Square Rubble Masonry See . In this type, the s tones are of varying sizes of different heights, but with straight edges and . 5.11(b) Coursed random rubble masonry Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.14 sides. They are laid in irregular pattern. Hence, no regular courses are achieved. A uniform joint is made in the facing of the masonry for better appearance. (b) Coursed squared Rubble Masonry See . This type of masonry also uses the same stones as used for uncoursed squared rubble. But, the work is carried out and leveled in courses of different heights. Each course may consist of quoins, jamb and bonders. (iii) polygonal Rubble Masonry In this type, the stones are hammer finished on the face of the wall to an irregular polygonal shape. These stones are bedded in position to show the face joints, running irregularly in all the directions. 2. Ashlar Masonry In Ashlar Masonry, no irregular stones are used. The entire construction is done using square or rectangular dressed stone blocks of required dimensions. The beds, sides and faces of the stones used in this masonry are all dressed finely with chisel. The height of stones varies from 25 to 30 cm. This masonry is laid in courses with thin end joints. It is the highest grade of masonry and costly. By arranging stones in various patterns, different types of appearance can be obtained. The backing of ashlar masonry may be built with stone rubble or brick masonry. (i) Ashlar Fine Masonry See . This type of ashlar masonry is very costly. In this masonry, all the stone blocks used should be finely chisel dressed on all the beds, sides and faces. Height of each course is generally not less than 30 cm. Thickness of mortar joint should never be more than 3 mm.The face stones are laid as headers and stretchers . 5.11(c) Un-coursed squared rubble masomary .15 alternatively. For walls having thickness less than 75 cm. Through stones should be used at suitable intervals at each course for proper bond. This type of masonry gives perfect smooth appearance. (ii) Ashlar Rough – Tooled Masonry In this type of masonry, the beds and sides of each stone block are finely chisel dressed just in the same manner as for ashlar fine. But, the exposed face is dressed by rough tooling. A strip about 25 mm wide and made by means of chisel is provided around the perimeter of the rough dressed face of each stone. The thickness of mortar should not be more than 6mm. (iii) Ashlar Rock or Quarry Faced Masonry In this type, a strip of 25 m wide, made by means of a chisel is provided around the perimeter of the exposed face of each stone as in the case of rough-tooled masonry. However, the remaining portion of the face of the stone is left in the same form as received from the quarry. It is not dressed. It is kept as such so as to give rock or quarry facing. Each stone block is maintained to its size with perfect straight sides, faces and beds and truly rectangular in shape. The thickness of mortar joint may be up to 10m. (iv) Ashlar Chamfered Masonry This is a special form of rock-faced ashlar masonry. In this masonry, a strip provided around the perimeter of the exposed face ic chamfered or beveled at an angle of 45° using the chisel to a depth of 25m. Due to this, a groove is formed in between the adjacent blocks of stone. Around this chambered strip, another strip of 10 mm to 12 mm wide is dressed with the help of chisel. The space inside this strip is kept rock-faced, except the large projections that are removed by a hammer. (v) Ashlar Facing Masonry See . This masonry may be called as a combination of ashlar masonry and rubble masonry. In this type of masonry, only face work is provided with rough tooled or hammer dressed stones. Backing of the wall may be made in rubble masonry or brick masonry or concrete. The beds and sides except exposed face are dressed perfectly fine and square. Thickness of joint does not exceed 6 mm. Uses This type of construction is used for heaving engineering works such as retaining walls, sea walls, etc. (vi) Ashlar Block-in-Course Masonry This type of masonry is an intermediate approach between the ashlar masonry and rubble masonry. It is constructed of large stone blocks. The faces of each stone block are hammer dressed. This masonry has regular courses. It is actually coursed rubble masonry of superior variety. The height of the blocks is kept the same in any course, though it is not necessary to keep uniform height for all the courses. .16 5.3.4 points to be Observed while Supervising the Construction of Stone Masonry 1. The stones to be used should conform with the requirements of work. 2. The stones should be well watered so that absorption of water from mortar is prevented. 3. Stones are laid on their natural bed. 4. Stone work should be carried out in proper bond with sufficient number of through stones. 5. The mortar should be of good quality. 6. Stone work should be raised uniformly. If a cross wall is to be constructed later, steps should be provided in the wall. 7. Double scaffolding should be used to carry out stone work at a higher level. 8. The vertical faces must be checked with a plumb and inclined surfaces with wooden templates. 9. The stone work should be cured for 2-3 weeks if laid in lime mortar and for 1-2 weeks if cement mortar is used.",

Natural Bed All the stones should be laid on the natural bed only. 4. Mortar Cement mortar or sometimes rich lime mortar in suitable proportion is used. 5. pressure Acting on the Stone Stones in the stone masonry are laid such that the pressure acting on the stones is perpendicular to the natural bed of the stones. 6. Tensile load Stone masonry work should not be designed to take any tensile load. 7. Watering Stones should be watered before use to prevent water absorption from mortar. 8. Course of stones Different courses of stones laid perpendicular to the line of action of pressure on the stones. 9. Through Stones Through stones should be used sufficiently such that they cover about 15 to 25% of the area in elevation. This is to ensure proper bonding. 10. Surface of Stone Masonry Surfaces of stone masonry should always be kept wet while the work is in progress and also till the mortar has set. 11. Vertical Joints Extreme care has to be taken by providing proper bond to prevent formation of vertical joints. Vertical joints should be staggered. 12. Lap between Bond Stones Bond stones running to full thickness of walls should be used at regular intervals. For thicker walls, the minimum overlap between the bond stones should be 15 cm. 13. Facing of Stone Masonry Small stone pieces are used for facing of stone masonry. 14. Hearting Hearting of masonry should be properly packed with stone chips and mortar. Superstructure 5.17 15. Verticality Verticality of faces of stone masonry walls are checked with a plumb Rule. 16. Inclined Surfaces Inclined surfaces should be checked with wooden templates. 17. Unequal Settlement Stone wall should be raised uniformly throughout its length. It will avoid possible unequal settlement. 18. Future Work If a cross wall is to be built later, steps should be provided in the wall. 19. Voids in Masonry Voids in stone masonry should not be dry-packed or filled with small size aggregates. Instead, they should be well-packed with large aggregate and mortar. 20. Stepped Raking Unfinished end of stone masonry should be raked back. This stepped raking develops proper bond between the old and the new works. 21. Curing After the construction is over, the whole masonry work should be kept cured for two to four weeks. 22.

    "text": "Beams are horizontal members of a structure, carrying transverse loads. Beams carry the floor slab or the roof slab. They transfer all the loads (the dead load and live loads) including its self weight to the vertical members of the structures. The vertical members may be columns or walls supporting the beams. Ultimately, the loads from the columns or walls are transmitted to the foundation. From the foundation, the loads are safely transmitted to the sub-soil. The RCC beam is subjected to bending moments and shear. Due to the vertical external load, bending compresses the top fibres of the beams and elongates the bottom fibres. The strength of an RCC beam depends on the composite action of concrete and steel. Since concrete is strong in compression and weak in tension, Reinforcing main steel bars are embedded in the tension zone to give the required tensile strength. Concrete takes all the compressive stresses and main steel bars take all the tensile stresses. In addition to the main reinforcement, vertical shear bars called stirrups are provided to withstand shearing forces. Beams may be termed simple beams when the end connections do not carry any end moments due to any continuity developed by the connection. A beam is continuous when it extends across more than two supports and is called a fixed beam if the ends are rigidly attached to other members so that a moment can be carried across the connection. Beams may be classified as follows. Girders Main load carrying members into which floor beams or joists frame. Joists Members used to carry roofing and floors of buildings. Lintels Beam members used to carry wall loads over wall openings. Contd. Superstructure 5.19 Spandrels Exterior beams at the floor level used to carry part of the floor load and the load due to exterior walls. Stringers Members used in bridges parallel to the traffic to carry the deck slab and commonly frames into transverse members. 1. Floor Beams These are the secondary members of a floor system in a building and the main members in bridge construction into which stringers frame. In most cases for maximising economy, a rolled steel shape is used so that the bending is about the strong axis. Beams can be of steel, concrete, timber or stone; generally, steel and concrete are used. In case of the reinforced concrete beam, due to the vertical external load, bending compresses the top fibres of the beam and elongates the bottom fibres. Concrete being weak in tension needs to be strengthened to take up the tension induced in the bottom fibres. Hence steel rods are added to concrete at places where tension is induced thereby making the beam strong in compression as well as in tension. Beam loading will consist of both dead and live loads. Where the span is small and the external load is light, the beam weight may be quite small. When heavy beams are used for large spans, their self-weight may be significant. In any case, the designed section should always be checked for adequacy for the applied loads, and the self-weight of the beam. 2. Types of Beams Depending on the support, a beam may be of any one of the following types: 1. Simply supported beam 2. Fixed beam 3. Cantilever beam 4. Continuous beam 5. Overhanging beam (i) Simply Supported Beam A beam supported freely at the two ends on walls or columns is called a simply supported beam. It is important to note that in actual practice, no beam rests freely on the supports (walls or columns) without fixing on the supports. Hence, no beam is practically simply supported. End connections (supports) do not carry any end moments due to the non-continuity developed by the connections of beam and supports. (ii) Fixed Beam In a fixed beam, both the ends of the beams are rigidly fixed or embedded into the supports (walls or columns). Main reinforcement bars and shear bars (stirrups) are placed as in the case of simply supported beams. Here, bending is constrained at the supports. A moment can be carried across the end connections. (iii) Cantilever beam When a beam is fixed in a wall or column at one end and the other end is free, it is called a cantilever beam. This type of beam has tension zone in the top side and a compression zone in the bottom side. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.20 . Examples are portico, balcony, etc. (iv) Continuous Beams A beam is said to be continuous beam when it is supported on more than two supports. This beam is more economical for any span lengths. .21 T-Beam As the name suggests, the section of this beam is in the shape of ‘T’. The design concept of a T-beam is the monolithic action of the slab with the flange and rib portions of the beams. A T-beam is developed when a slab is cast monolithically with the beam and the slab extends on both the sides of the beams. L-Beam An L-beam is developed when a slab extends on one side of the beam only and is monolithic. L-beams are used at the end walls of a room. (v) Overhanging Beam In an overhanging beam, its end extends beyond the wall or column support. The overhanging of the beam is the unsupported portion of the beam. It may be on side or both the sides of the support. . (ii) Doubly reinforcement beam If the main reinforcement of steel bars is provided both at top and bottom (tension and compression zones) of the beam, it is known as a doubly reinforced beam. See . Concrete covers Main bars are placed uniformly along the perimeter of the column leaving required covers. Concrete cover is the distance between the outer surface of the member and the nearest point of reinforcement. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.22 Bottom cover and End cover The minimum bottom cover to be provided in the beam is 25 mm or the diameter of the bar, whichever is more. The end cover is 25 mm or twice the diameter of the bar, whichever is more. . 5.17(b) Double reinforced beam Types of Loading on Beams See . Loading on a beam may be different types. They are (i) Concentrated loads (ii) Uniformly distributed loads (iii) Uniformly varying loads (iv) Arbitrary loading .23 Steel Beams Steel beams are generally rolled steel I-sections. I-sections with cover plates may be used when a large modulus of section is required. An I-section may be split and rejoined by welding and used for beams with large spans and light loads. Such a beam is more resistant to bending as the modulus of the section is increased. An I-section along with a channel section is used when the beam is subjected to lateral loads at the compression flange level of the section.",

If leff ___ a £ 12, it is a short column and If leff ___ a > 12, it is designated as a long column where leff is the effective length of column which depends on the conditions of the end support, and a is the least lateral dimension of the column or diameter of column in case of circular columns. A short column is one in which the ultimate load at a given eccentricity is governed only by the strength of materials and the dimensions of the cross-section. A slender or long column is one in which the ultimate load is also influenced by slenderness, which produces additional bending because of transverse deformations. Thus we see, for short columns, the failure load is characterised by yielding and for long columns by buckling or instability. Members with lengths that fall between short and long columns are called intermediate columns. These fail by both yielding and buckling. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.24",

    "text": "1. RCC Columns If the effective length of a compression member is equal to or less than thrice the least lateral dimension, the member is made of plain cement concrete. If the effective length of a compression member is more than thrice the least lateral dimension, the member should be reinforced. Reinforced concrete columns are of square, rectangular or circular cross sections. The load carrying capacity of the column depends on the strength of concrete and steel. If the percentage of steel used is less in a column, the steel will reach its yield strength prior to concrete. The column will not fail since it can take more load at this stage. Due to this increase in load, steel will yield and the concrete will reach its full strength. Hence, the strength of the entire material is utilised. On the other hand, if the percentage of steel used is large, then concrete fails first and the failure will be spontaneous. Uses RCC columns are used in multi-storeyed buildings and heavily loaded structures. RCC columns are very widely used now-a-days. 2. Steel Columns or Stanchions Steel columns are also known as stanchions. These are widely used in industrial structures. Steel columns are fabricated using rolled steel joists, channels, angles and plates. A steel column is a vertical compression member. It supports or girders in a building. A girder is a main load carrying member into which floor beams or joists are connected. Joists are beam members, which are used to carry floors and roofs of buildings of light loads supported on long columns. The shape of the cross section of the steel section and the sectional area should be designed carefully to avoid buckling. The important property required for a compression member is a high value of moment of inertia. I-sections, tubular sections and two equal- angle steel sections may be used for light loads. Single-angle sections should be avoided for steel columns. 5.5.3 Built-Up Sections for Steel Columns When two or three steel sections of rolled sheets and plates are connected to form a column, it is known as a built-up column or box column. See . Built-up sections are compression structural members with wide flanges. Hence, these are used for heavy loads. The type of built-up section to be used depends on the type of structure and the end connections of the columns. Steel compression members are pipes of circular, square or rectangular cross-sections and sections such as angles, channels, T or I-sections. These may also be built up of rolled sheets and plates. The kind of compression member to be used depends on the end connections and type of structure. Superstructure 5.25 Built-up sections for commonly used compression members are shown in . The pipe or round tubing shown in . Wide-flange shapes are commonly used as building columns. Single channels can be used as compression members if intermediate bracing is provided in the weak direction.

    "text": "A lintel is a horizontal member which is placed across an opening to support the portion of the structure above it. The function of a lintel is same as that of a beam. Lintels may be of wood, steel, brick, stone and reinforced cement concrete. Each type is briefly explained in this section. 1. Wood Lintel A single piece of timber can be used as a lintel or three pieces bolted together along the thickness of the wall can be adopted. A bearing of 150 – 200 mm should be provided on the wall and it should be placed on mortar. The width is equal to the thickness of opening and depth should be about 1/12 to 1/8 of the span with a minimum of 80 mm. Wood lintels are liable to be destroyed by fire and decay. They are comparatively weak. Wood lintels help in securing heads of frames of timber doors and windows. 2. Stone Lintel Slabs of stones are placed across the openings. If stones are used as lintels, relieving arches are to be provided since stones have low tensile resistance. The depth of stone lintel should be at least one mm per one cm length of the opening. [May/June 2012] 3. Brick Lintel A temporary wood support known as turning piece is used to construct a brick lintel. The depth of the lintel must be some multiple of brick courses.

Steel Lintel This lintel consists of steel angles or rolled steel joists. The former is used for small spans and the latter for large spans. Tube separators are provided to keep the joists in position. Joists are embedded in concrete to protect steel from corrosion and fire.  5. Reinforced Cement Concrete Lintel RCC has replaced practically all other materials for lintel. RCC lintels are fire-proof, durable, strong and easy to construct. The usual concrete mix used for lintel is 1:2:4. Plain concrete lintels can be used up to a span of 800 mm. The amount of reinforcement depends upon the span.  RCC lintels can be precast or cast-in-situ. Precast RCC lintels are convenient for spans up to 2 m. Also, they increase the speed of construction and allow sufficient time for curing before fixing. The top of the lintel should be properly marked with tar or paint so that the lintel can be placed correctly. For cast- in-situ RCC lintels, centering is prepared, reinforcement is placed and concreting is done. Sunshades can be easily projected from the lintels. Where appearance is not important, the surface of RCC lintel is left exposed. Figure 5.20 shows a lintel over a wall. Flexible DPC must be provided and the toe of the lintel should be strong enough to bear the load of wall above it. . 5.20 Reinforced concrete lintel Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.28",

    "text": "Flat roofs are used in buildings of any shape. They are economical too. They are suitable for buildings in plains or in hot regions, where rainfall is moderate and where there is no snowfall. Flat roofs are two types, namely, RCC roofs and Madras terrace roof. Rcc Roofs  An RCC roof is commonly and most widely used. In this roof, concrete with steel reinforcement bars is used to form a flat roof. An RCC roof consists of an RCC slab, built monolithically with the supporting columns. The slab is reinforced in both the principal directions. Load is carried by the slab, which is directly supported by the columns. The thickness of the roof slab depends on the span and loading conditions. (An RCC beam may also be provided to support the slab. The thickness of the roof slab, beam and reinforcement are designed based on the roof and the loading conditions.) The roof-slab thickness may be 80 to 150 mm. Columns are provided with enlarged heads known as column heads. To support heavy loads, the thickness of the slab over the columns may be increased. The thickened part of the slab is called a drop panel. Damp Proof Course It prevents entry of moisture (dampness) due to a leaking roof. Weathering course or weathering-proof course is provided on the top of an RCC roof to prevent the roof from the weathering agencies like sun, rain, wind, and snow. Also, it minimizes the heat radiation into the room below the roof.

After curing for 6 days, two courses of flat tiles or one course of pressed tiles may be laid in a cement mortar ratio of 1:3 mixed with crude oil. Construction of Flat RCC Roof Details Centering Centering sheets or planks are arranged horizontally at the top levels of wall over the wooden are steel supports. Grid of steel bar Main reinforcement mild steel bars of diameter 9 m to18 mm are tied in the form of grid of the centering sheets as per design. Cover RCC slab bends downwards, causing tension at the bottom fibers. Hence, steel bars are placed at the bottom of slab, keeping a minimum clear cover of 15 mm between the bars and centering sheets. Mixing cement concrete Cement concrete of 1: 2: 4 mix is mixed thoroughly with sufficient quantity of water manually or in concrete mixer and placed on the centering sheets. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.30 Compaction of the concrete The concrete is compacted well manually or by using mechanical vibrator to the required thickness and the top surface is levelled. Slope of the roof Surface of the roof at the top of the building is given a gentle slope up to 10˚ for draining- off rain water easily and rapidly. Curing Curing is carried out for one or two weeks to facilitate continued hydration of cement.

Concrete trusses are rarely adopted since these are weak in tension. Steel trusses are less massive when compared to concrete but need frequent maintenance as they are liable to be rusted. They must be painted with anti-corrosive paints. Steel trusses are adopted in bridges also. There are various types of trusses out of which the common types are shown in . Fink truss North light truss Howe truss Bow string truss Compound fink or French truss Arch truss . Sloping roof or pitched roof is commonly used at places of coastal regions of heavy rain fall and snow fall. These are comparatively light in weight. Shapes of sloping roofs depend on the area to be covered, material used, light and ventilation needed, etc. 1. Terminology (i) Span Span is the distance between the supports of a roof or truss. (ii) pitch Pitch is the inclination of the sides of a roof to the horizontal (iii) Rafter Rafter is an inclined wooden member running from the ridge to eave. (iv) Wall plate Wall plate is placed at the top of the walls to support the rafter. (v) eave board It is fixed along the eave joining the pair of rafters. (vi) Ridge piece Ridge piece is a horizontal member, running along the length of the roof. (vii) Battens Battens are small sections of the timber fixed to the rafters for placing the roofing material on the sloping roof. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.32 (viii) purlins Purlins are horizontal members kept over the tie beam to support the rafters. (ix) Truss Truss is a frame work of triangles, used to carry the load of the roof-covering materials and other members of the roof. 2. Sloping Roofs are Classified as • Single roof • Double or Purlin roof • Trussed roof (i) Single Roof Single roofs consist of only common rafters, supporting the roofing material. Rafters are supported at the wall plates and rigid pieces. Single roofs are used for spans up to 5m, so that no intermediate support is required for the rafters. The varieties of single roofs are (a) lean-to-roof, (b) coupled roof, (c) coupled close roof, and (d) collar roof. (a) Lean-To-Roof See . A lean-to-roof is the simplest type of sloping roof. It is used for verandahs, car sheds, out-houses, etc., attached to the main buildings. This roof projects from the main wall of the building. Its span is limited to 2.5 m only. Common rafters are provided at an angle of about 30° to the horizontal. These are kept at uniform intervals along the length of the roof. These are secured on the wall plates at both the ends. The upper wall plate rests on stone or steel corbel on the main wall. Battens (wooden) are fixed to the rafter. Roof coverings are fixed to the battens as shown. Roof coverings may be AC sheets or tiles. .33 (b) Coupled roof See . In a coupled roof, a pair or coupled of rafters slope upwards from the walls. The rafters are kept at uniform intervals along the length of the roof. The rafters are connected at the upper end to a longitudinal beam called the ridge piece. The ridge piece is running along the length of the roof. . The wall plates are fixed on the supporting walls. The roofing materials such as AC sheets or Tiles are supported on battens, which are fixed to the rafters. Coupled roof is suitable for spans up to 3.5 m. It is not favoured, as the rafters have a tendency to spread out at the lower ends and thrust out of the wall. (c) Coupled close roof See . This is similar to the coupled roof except that, the lower ends of the rafters are connected to a tie beam at the bottom. There is a tie beam for each pair of rafters. When the length of the rafters becomes larger, the rafters will have a tendency to spread out and thrust out of the walls. The tendency of spreading out of rafters can be arrested with the tie beam. Such a roof is called a coupled close roof. A coupled close roof is suitable for spans up to 4.5 metres. (d) Collar beam roof See . This is similar to the coupled close roof. The only difference is that the tie beam is fixed at a height of 1/2 to 1/3 of the vertical height between the wall and the ridge piece. This raised beam is called a collar beam. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.34 The tie beam is raised to prevent the coupled close roof from bending due to increase in span or increase in load. This roof is suitable for spans of up to 5 metres. (ii) Double or purlin roof See . In this type, additional members called purlins are provided at intermediate points. Purlins support the common rafters. The size of rafters can be reduced by the use of purlins. Purlins rest on the collar beam. This roof is suitable for spans of up to 5.5 metres. Each rafter is supported at four points, namely, (i) at the bottom on the wall, (ii) at the top by the ridge piece, (iii) at the centre by the collar beam, and (iv) at the intermediate supports by purlins. . 5.27 Coupled tie roof Superstructure 5.35 (iii) Trussed roofs A number of straight members connected in the shape of triangle and forming a frame is known as truss. Trusses are wooden-framed structures, provided where there are no inside walls to support the purlins. Trusses are provided at regular intervals of about 3 meters along the room length. The spacing of trusses depends upon the load on the roof, position of cross walls, span and material of the truss. Ends of purlins are supported by the trusses. The purlins provide intermediate support to the common rafters, which in turn support the roof coverings. Trussed roofs are used for spans exceeding 5 metres.",

    "text": "(i) Ties Tension carrying members in the truss are called ties. (ii) Struts Compression members in the truss are called struts. (iii) Span The distance between the supporting ends of a truss is called its span. (iv) Rise The rise of the truss is the vertical distance between the apex and the line joining the supports. (v) pitch The ratio of the rise to the span is called the pitch. (vi) purlins Purlins provide intermediate support to the common rafters. The common types of trussed roofs are (a) King-post truss (b) Queen-post truss (c) Steel-roof truss .36 (a) King-post truss See . A king-post truss is a timber truss. It consists of a king post at the centre, two inclined struts, two inclined principal rafters and a tie beam at the bottom. The vertical central post which connects the ridge piece with the tie beam is known as the king-post truss. The truss rests on a bed block of stone or concrete at either end. The bed blocks rest on walls. The roofing material is supported on common rafters. The common rafters are supported on wooden purlins provided at suitable intervals. Purlins are supported by the principal rafters. The king post connects the ridge piece and the middle of the tie beam. . Struts prevent the principal rafters from bending at the centre. The roofing material is fixed to the common rafters. These are used for spans in the range of 5 – 9 metres. It is usually built of wood completely or of wood combined with steel. Steel rods are used as tension members. (b) Queen-post truss A queen-post truss is used for spans from 9 – 12 meters. It is also a timber truss. It consists of two queen posts instead of one as in king post truss. (c) Steel roof truss Timber trusses become very heavy and costly, when the span exceeds 10 meters. Mild steel is readily available in rolled sections of standard shapes and sizes, namely, angles, channel sections, T-sections, I-sections, etc. Steel roof trusses are mostly fabricated from angle sections. The reason is that they can resist both tension and compression effectively. Steel-roof trusses are frames formed by a number of straight members, made of steel angles. These members are connected in the shape of triangles. The members are jointed together by welding or riveting. External loads act at these joints of the members. The Superstructure 5.37 shape and positioning of members in a steel truss are designed such that the members are subjected to either tension or compression. The compression members are called struts and should be short to avoid buckling. The tension members are known as ties. Trusses do not have any bending stresses in them. The principal rafter and the main ties are generally made of two angle sections placed side by side. The struts and ties are generally made of single angle section. Advantages of steel roof trusses 1. Steel trusses are more rigid and stronger than wooden trusses. 2. Members of the steel trusses are equally strong in both tension and compression. 3. They can be used over any span length ranging from 4.5 meters to very large spans up to 30 metres. 4. They are easy to fabricate from rolled steel sections, which are readily available in the required dimensions. 5. They are more economical compared to timber trusses. 6. Steel trusses are permanent structures with durability of a very long life. 7. Steel trusses are more resistant to environmental/ atmospheric agencies. 8. They are fire resistant unlike timber. 9. They are termite-proof unlike timber. 10. They can be easily installed. Disadvantages of steel roof trusses Steel roof trusses are likely to get rusted. They must be painted with anti-corrosive paints. Hence, steel trusses need periodical maintenance. Uses 1. In construction of buildings of large spans such as educational institutions, industries, auditoriums, theatres, godowns, warehouses, garages, etc., including bridges. 2. No intermediate columns in the above type of buildings and availability of a clear and un-obstructed working space. 3. Places of heavy rain fall or snow fall. Types of steel roof trusses The type, size, and relative positions of members of a steel roof truss are based on the span, roof slope, load coming over the roof, roof covering material and centre to centre of the truss. 1. King post steel truss See . The relative positions of the members of the truss, namely, main tie, rafters and struts are shown. The steel truss shown in Fig. (1) can be used for spans up to 4.5 metres. The steel truss shown in Fig. (2) can be used for spans up to 6 meters. 2. Simple fink steel truss See . Fink-type truss is found to be very satisfactory for ordinary buildings. These trusses are used for spans up to 8 metres. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.38 3. Simple Howe’s steel truss These trusses are used for spans of up to 12 metres. 4. Compound fink steel truss or french truss These trusses are used for spans up to 15 meters. This type truss is also known as French truss. 5. Compound Howe’s steel truss See . These trusses are also used for spans up to 15 metres. In this truss, the diagonals are in compression and the verticals are in tension under dead load. 6. North light steel truss See . These trusses are used for spans up to 15 metres. This type of truss is used for industrial buildings to obtain adequate natural lighting for a wide building. In this, the steep sides of the truss are glazed. The glazed panel is faced towards north to avoid direct sunlight and direct glaring of the sun. This type of truss is also known as saw tooth. 7. Bowstring steel truss These trusses are used for spans of up to 30 metres. . 5.32 Compound Howe’s steel truss . 5.33 Compound fink steel truss .39",

    "text": "The selection of proper roof covering depends on the climate of the locality, nature of the building, cost of the roof coverings and resistance to fire and heat. Some of the commonly used roof coverings are discussed below: Thatch Thatch is very light and is the cheapest form of roof covering. It is combustible, absorbs moisture and is liable to decay. Thatch is used in rural areas at a pitch of 45° to have proper drainage. Half-round tiles These are used for cheap buildings. If tiles are laid in two layers, it is known as double tiled roof. An overlap of at least 80 mm should be provided for these tiles. These are brittle and hence require frequent replacement. Shingles Wood shingles are obtained from timber with length varying from 300–380 mm and width of 60–250 mm. They are laid in the same manner as tiles and are useful in hilly areas where wood is cheap. Patent tiles Mangalore tiles are one of the patent tiles. They are red in colour and special tiles are available for ridge. It is found that about 15 tiles are required to cover 1 m2 of roof area. Trafford asbestos cement tiles These are made up of cement and asbestos. They possess less corrugations and are laid with laps of 150 mm at the ends and 100 mm at the sides. Eternit slates These are fire resistant, light and cool. They are not easily affected by weather. About 8 slates are required for covering 1 m2 of roof area. Eternit slates are available in grey, black and red colours. Corrugated galvanised iron sheets These are used as roof covering for factories, sheds, cheap buildings etc. They may be covered with country tiles so as to keep the interior side of the building cool. Sheets are laid with the corrugations running down the slope of the roof. Laps of 15 cm are to be provided at the ends. These sheets are light in weight and are easy to fix. Asbestos – cement corrugated sheets These sheets can be cut, nailed, sawn or screwed and they are light, non-absorptive, strong and tough. These sheets can withstand extreme variation of temperature. . 5.36 Bowstring steel truss Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.40 Ruberoid This is a light, flexible and waterproof material. This is not affected by atmospheric agents and white ants. These are available in red and grey colours. Its weight varies from 10–20 N/m2 and it is available in rolls.",

    "text": "Weatherproof course is also known as weathering course. Weathering course is a layer provided on the top of RCC or Madras terrace roof to protect the roof from the weathering agencies like rain, wind, sun and snow. Weathering course prevents entry of rain water into the roof slab or terrace. It also arrests the penetration of heat into the room below the roof. Weathering course consists of lime concrete with broken brick aggregate and two courses of flat tiles set in cement mortar 1:3 mixed with crude oil. Lime concrete has a proportion of 1:2.5 (lime:broken brick aggregate). Lime concrete is laid to a thickness of 100 mm and compacted to a thickness of 75 mm. A minimum slope of 1 in 50 is given to the lime concrete layer towards the rainwater drainage pipes. After the concrete is cured, by sprinkling water for six days, two courses of flat tiles are laid in cement mortar 1:3 with crude oil. Methods of Weather Proofing in RCC Slab Roofs 1. In the case of RCC slab roofs, to prevent the entry of rain water, a 10 cm thick brick-bats lime concrete (1:2:4) or brick-bats cement concrete (1:8:14) terracing is provided over the roof slab as shown in . Over this concrete terracing, a suitable flooring such as CC tiles, terrazo, China mosaic, Indian patent stone, etc. is laid. This technique of weather proofing is illustrated in . A good fall or slope to the surface from 1 in 20 to 1 in 40, depending upon the intensity of rainfall should be given. 2. An alternative technique of weather proofing the RCC flat roofs is by using plastic transparent films, as shown in . These films of alkathene or Polythene are available in thicknesses from 100 to 700 gauge in rolls of 1.8 m width. 3. Another technique of weather proofing the flat roofs, made of wooden battens, RCC joists or Jack arches, etc. is illustrated in .

Linoleum flooring 1. Mud and Moorum Flooring Mud Flooring Method of construction The floor bed should be well prepared and a 250 mm thick layer of selected moist earth is evenly spread out and is rammed well so as to get a consolidated thickness of 150 mm. No water is used during the process of ramming. In order to prevent formation of cracks after drying, chopped straw in small quantity is mixed with the moist earth before ramming. Upon this bed, a thin coat of cement, cowdung plaster (1 cement: 4 cowdung) is applied evenly and wiped clean by hand. Moorum Flooring Method of construction In this type of floor, a hard bed is prepared by laying a 25-cm thick layer of hand packed rubble boulders and then wetted and rammed hard. Upon this hard bed, a 15-cm thick layer of moorum (disintegrated rock) with coarse pieces at the bottom and finer at the top is laid. Over this layer of moorum another 25-mm thick layer of powdered moorum is spread. Water should then be sprinkled on the entire surface and rammed well. Finally, over the dry hard surface a thin coat of cement plaster (1 cement: 4 cowdung) is applied evenly and wiped cleanly by hand. Suitability Mud floors are generally used for unimportant buildings particularly in villages. Advantages They are cheap, hard, fairly impervious and easy in construction and maintenance. 2. Brick Flooring Method of construction In this flooring the subgrade is compacted properly to the desired level. 10-15 cm thick layer of lean cement concrete ( 1: 8: 16) or lime concrete is laid over the prepared subgrade. This forms the base course, over which bricks are laid in desired pattern on 12mm thick mortar bed in such a way that all the joints are filled with mortar. Suitability Brick floors are suitable for warehouses, stones and godowns or in places where bricks are available economically. Advantages This floor is cheap, non-slippery, durable, sufficiently hard and easily repairable. Superstructure 5.45 . Stone Flooring Method of construction The subgrade is prepared by laying a 100 mm to 150 mm thick layer of cement or lime concrete over a bed of well consolidated earth. The stone slabs may be square or rectangular, usually 300 mm × 300 mm, 450 mm × 450 mm, 600 mm × 600 mm or 450 mm × 600 mm size. The thickness of stone varies from 20 mm to 40 mm. The selected stone should be hard, durable, good quality and of uniform thickness and the surface. The stones should be finely chisel dressed on surface and should have their edges true and parallel from side top side. When the stone slabs are properly set, mortar in the joints is raked out to a depth of 20 mm and flush pointed with cement mortar 1:3. Suitability This type of flooring is suitable for godowns, sheds, stores, bus shelter, schools, hospitals, etc. Advantages Where stones are available in plenty, this floor is economical. It is hard, durable, easy to construct and has good resistance to wear and tear. 4. Cement Concrete Flooring Method of Construction This flooring is commonly used for residential, commercial and even industrial buildings. The floor consists of two components: (i) Base concrete The base course is laid over well-compacted soil, compacted properly and leveled to a rough surface. The base course consists of 7.5 cm to 10 cm thick cement concrete( 1:3:6 to 1:5:10). The top surface of the concrete base is roughly finished to develop good bond between the base and topping. (ii) Wearing surface After the base concrete has hardened, its surface is brushed with stiff broom and cleaned thoroughly. The entire surface is divided into square of rectangular panels not exceeding 2.5 m in length. Cement concrete 1:2:4 of thickness 25 mm to 40 mm is then laid in alternate panels. The top surface is beaten and made Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.46 in a uniform line and level, and finally it is smoothened by trowelling. The surface is kept under curing for 10 days. . Advantages It is cheap and durable, easy to maintain and it is fire resistant. 5. Granolithic flooring  Method of Construction In this flooring the sub-base preparation and concrete base laying is done in a similar manner, as explained for cement concrete flooring. A finishing layer is given above is made of very rich concrete mix with hard stone chips, called granolithic finish. To improve wearing qualities, sand may be replaced by crushed granite powder. The surface may be finished smooth with a steel trowel. The floor area may be divided into panels of size 600 mm × 600 mm or 600 mm × 450 mm using threads, if desired. Suitability This type of flooring is mostly suitable for industrial floors. Advantages It is durable, cheap, resistant to abrasion and does not wear easily. . Terrazzo flooring Method of construction In this flooring the sub-base preparation and concrete base laying is done in a similar manner, as explained for cement concrete flooring. The top layer may have about 40 mm thickness, consisting of (i) 34 mm thick cement concrete layer(1:2:4) laid Superstructure 5.47 over the base concrete, and (ii) about 6mm thick terrazzo topping. Terrazzo is a specially prepared concrete surface consisting of white cement with marble chips of different colours in 1:2 proportion, laid in a thin layer over a concrete base course. Even though this flooring is expensive, it is decorative and has good wearing properties. Suitability This type of flooring is suitable for hospitals, public buildings, living room and bathrooms of residential buildings, etc. Advantages It provides an attractive, clean and durable surface. . 7. Mosaic flooring Method of Construction Mosaic flooring is made of small pieces of broken tiles of glazed china, cement, or of marble, arranged in different patterns. These pieces are cut to desired shapes and sizes. This floor is normally laid over a hard bed of cement concrete. The top surface of the concrete base is cleaned and wetted. On a small portion of the floor, a layer of rich cement , mortar 1:3 is evenly spread in a thickness of nearly 1cm and mosaic tiles are laid with hand and set properly in desired pattern. Dry cement either ordinary or coloured is sprinkled and pressed in the joints. The process is continued for the whole floor. The joints of the tiles are then rubbed with a corborundum stone. After the tiles are set, the surface is completely polished with a mosaic-polishing machine. Suitability This type of flooring is suitable for use in operation theatres, bathrooms, public buildings, etc. 8. Marble flooring  Method of Construction This flooring is laid over the prepared subgrade which is cleaned, wetted and mopped properly. A layer of cement mortar of 1:4 is spread in an average thickness of about 20 mm. Marble slabs are laid in this bedding mortar, pressed and leveled. The marble slabs may be rectangular or square in shape and their thickness varies from 20 to 40 mm. The joints between two slabs must be very thin. The cement that oozes out of the joints is cleaned. The paved area is cured for a minimum of seven days. Suitability It is suitable for places of worship and for public buildings which require rich appearance, kitchens, bathrooms, operation theatres and hospitals. etc., Advantages It is attractive and easily maintained. Disadvantages It requires high initial cost. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.48 . Wood or Timber Flooring Method of construction Timber flooring is used for dancing halls, auditoriums, etc. There are two types of timber floors: (i) Suspended type (ii) Solid type (i) Suspended-type timber flooring Where the problem of dampness is acute, the timber flooring is provided above the ground level. In such a case, sleeper walls are constructed at centre to centre distance of 1.2 to 1.8 m. Wall plates are provided along the sleeper walls. The bridging joists of timber are nailed to the wall plates at their ends. They are placed at a centre to centre distance of about 30 cm. Finally, the floor boards are provided on the bridging joists to finish up the floor. (ii) Solid-type timber flooring Where the problem of dampness is not acute, timber floars may be supported on the ground all along. In this type of flooring base concrete is first laid in 15 cm to 20 cm thickness. Over it a layer of mastic asphalt is applied. Wooden block flooring is then laid over it. In order to fix the wooden floor on concrete slabs, longitudinal nailing strips, with beveled sections, are embedded in concrete at suitable intervals. Suitabilty It is suitable for dancing halls, auditoriums, carpentry halls, in hilly areas, where timber is available cheaply and in areas where temperature is very low. Advantages It provides a non-slippery platform and is easy to repair. Disadvantages This flooring is not commonly used for residential buildings due to its cost. Dampness prevention should be carried out before its construction. 10. Asphalt flooring Method of Construction Mastic is melted and clean sand is mixed with it and laid in one or two layers on the base of the concrete with a trowel. A uniform level surface can be obtained by quick trowel line before the mastic losses its plasticity and before it gets hardened. Suitability It is suitable for use under a wide range of service conditions from light domestic buildings to heavy duty commercial and industrial buildings, storage houses, foot paths etc. Superstructure 5.49 . The flooring is easily cleaned and resistant to acids. Asphalt floorings are of the following types. (i) Asphalt mastic flooring (ii) Asphalt tiles flooring (iii) Asphaltic terrazzo flooring (iv) Acidproof mastic flooring 1. Asphalt mastic flooring Asphalt mastic is a mixture of sand (or grit) and asphalt in the ratio of 2:1. It is mixed hot and then is laid in continuous sheets. It can also be applied cold, by mixing with mineral oil and asbestos. The thickness of the asphalt mastic may be 2.5 cm for ordinary construction. It is laid on cement concrete base and is spread by means of trowel to get a levelled surface. On the top of the surface, a thin layer of sand is spread, which is then rubbed with a trowel. The joints of mastic asphalt laid on successive days are properly lapped. 2. Asphalt tiles flooring These are prepared from asphalt, asbestos fibres, inert materials and mineral pigments, by pressing the mix in different sizes (20cm2–45cm2), with thickness varying from 3 –6 cm. Those tiles are either directly cemented to concrete base or are fixed on wooden floors by using an intervening layer of mastic asphalt or asphalt saturated felt. Asphaltic tiles are cheap, resilient, soundproof, non-absorbent and moisture proof. 3. Asphaltic terrazo flooring This is prepared like mastic asphalt, except that marble chips are used in the place of sand/grit. Asphalt may be either in black or other suitable colours and is laid in hot condition. 4. Acidproof mastic flooring Acidproof blocks of asphalt are available, which are manufactured from moulding acidproof asphalt and inert crushed rock aggregate under Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.50 high pressure. Asphalt blocks are first laid on concrete base and then acidproof asphalt is uniformly spread over the surface of the blocks. Fine sand is spread over the liquid asphalt before it hardens. 11. Industrial Flooring In most of the industries, cement concrete flooring is commonly adopted since it is moderately cheap, easy to construct and quite durable. The floor consists of the following two components: (a) Base concrete (b) Wearing surface The two components of the floor can be constructed either monolithically (i.e. laying the wearing surface immediately after the base concrete is laid) or non-monolithically. The method of laying cement concrete flooring on ground floor of an industry can be broadly divided into the following three steps: (a) Preparation of sub-base (b) Laying of the base concrete (c) Laying the wearing surface 1. preparation of sub-base The earth filling in plinth is consolidated thoroughly so as to ensure that no loose pockets are left in the whole area. Then a 10–15 cm thick layer of clean coarse sand is spread over the whole area. The sand layer is consolidated and dressed to the required level and slope. 2. Laying of base concrete The base course may be 7.5–10 cm thick, either in lean cement concrete (1:3:6 to 1:5:10) or lime concrete containing 40 per cent mortar of 1:2 lime-sand (or 1 lime : 1 surkhi : 1 sand) and 60 per cent coarse aggregate of 40 mm nominal size. The base course is laid over well-compacted soil, compacted properly and levelled to rough surface. It should be properly cured. 3. Laying the wearing surface The wearing surface is laid in square or rectangular panels, by using either glass or plain asbestos strips or by using wooden battens set on mortar bed. The panels may be 1 × 1 m, 2 × 2 m, 1 × 2 m in size. The wearing surface consists of 1:2:4 cement concrete, laid to the thickness of 4 cm. Before laying the concrete in the panel, a coat of neat cement slurry is applied to ensure proper bond of topping with the base course. Advantages (a) It possesses good wearing properties. (b) It is easy to construct and maintain. (c) It is non-absorbent, smooth and pleasing in appearance. (d) It is durable and hence it is commonly used in factories and industries. (e) It is economical. Superstructure 5.51 Disadvantages (a) It cannot be satisfactorily repaired by patch work. (b) Defects in carelessly made floor cannot be rectified and as such, it requires proper attention while laying. 12. Granite Flooring Granite flooring is a superior type of flooring commonly used in residential buildings, shopping complex, hospitals, offices, etc. where extra cleanliness is an essential requirement. Granite stone is available in the form of 8 mm and 12 mm thick tiles and 20 mm thick slab. These tiles and slabs are available in any shape and size. Before laying the tiles, neat cement slurry is spread over the bedding mortar and the tiles are laid flat over it. Then they are pressed gently into the bedding mortar with the help of wooden mallet, till a levelled surface is obtained. Also, a thin paste of cement is applied on the bottom of the tiles before laying. After a day, the joints between adjacent tiles are cleaned of loose mortar, etc. to a depth of 5 mm. This is done by using wire brush and then the joints are grouted with cement slurry of the same colour shade as that of the tiles. The flooring is then cured for seven days. 13. Linoleum Flooring Linoleum is produced from linseed oil, pigments, gum and wood or cork flour. Linoleum is laid on wooden or concrete floors to improve their durability and appearance. It is available in rolls having various colors and designs. Linoleum tiles are also available. It is attractive, economical and easy to wash. But it does not offer resistance against dampness and fire. Linoleum flooring is used in railway coaches, ships etc. 5.9 Damp-Proofing Damp-proofing is the method adopted to prevent the entry of dampness into a building, so as to keep them dry, habitable and safe. The provision of damp-proofing courses prevents the entry of moisture from walls, floors and basement of a building. 1. Causes of dampness There are various causes which are responsible for the entry of dampness in a structure. They are listed below. (i) entry of moisture from the ground Building materials used in the foundation may absorb moisture from the pervious soil by capillary action. This will lead to the entry of dampness to the floor and walls. (ii) entry of rain water The unprotected exposed surfaces and leaking roofs become sources of entry of rain water into a structure thereby leading to dampness. (iii) exposed tops of walls Dampness may enter through the exposed tops of parapet walls and compound walls. This may lead to serious consequences. (iv) Deposition of atmospheric moisture on walls, floors and ceilings When warm humid air is cooled, condensation of water vapour takes place. This is the main source which Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.52 causes dampness in walls, floors and ceilings. This is evident mainly in badly designed kitchens. (v) Location Dampness will enter into the structure which is located on a site that cannot be easily drained. (vi) Orientation of walls The walls obtaining less sunshine and heavy showers of rain are liable to become damp. (vii) Workmanship The dampness is also caused due to bad workmanship in construction such as defective rainwater pipe connections, defective joints in the roofs, improper connections of walls, etc. 2. Effects of dampness Following are the effects of dampness in a structure: 1. A damp building creates unhealthy conditions for those who occupy it. 2. Corrosion of the metals used in building construction is evident. 3. Formation of unsightly patches on the wall surfaces and ceilings. 4. Formation of dry-rot leading to the decay of timber in a damp atmosphere. 5. Deterioration of electrical fittings. 6. Floor covering materials are seriously damaged. 7. Acceleration of the growth of termites. 8. Softening and crumbling of the plaster. 3. Requirement of an ideal material for damp-proofing 1. The damp-proof course should remain effective during the life of the building. Hence, the material should be durable. 2. It should remain steady and should not allow any movement in itself. 3. It should be impervious. 4. The material should safely resist the load coming on it. 5. It should be strong enough to undergo some structural movement without fracture. 4. Materials used for damp-proofing (i) Hot bitumen It is flexible and should be applied with a minimum thickness of 3 mm. (ii) Mastic asphalt It is a semi-rigid material and it forms an excellent impervious layer. It is very durable but can withstand only slight distortion. (iii) Bituminous felts It is also flexible and it is available in rolls of normal width. This can accommodate slight movements. It is liable to squeeze out under pressure. (iv) Metal sheets of lead, copper and aluminium Metal sheets can also be used as damp- proofing material. These metal sheets are flexible and do not squeeze out under pressure. The surface of lead coming in contact with lime and cement will be corroded and hence Superstructure 5.53 it should be protected with bitumen. Aluminium sheets should also be protected with bitumen but copper does not require any protective coating. 5. Methods of damp-proofing 1. lf the level of the ground floor is in level with the ground surface or just above it, the damp-proofing course is provided as shown in .",

Sand to be used in the mortar should not pass through a 100 - mesh sieve for more than five per cent or a 50 mesh sieve for more than 20 per cent. Water and sand used should be clean and free from all deleterious materials. Fat lime or poor lime is used in lime plaster. To improve the strength of lime mortar, small quantity of cement is added. This mortar is mainly used for external work. 2. Cement plaster Cement plaster is an intimate mixture of Portland cement and sand with required amount of water to make a plastic mass. The proportion of cement and sand depends upon the nature of work. The ingredients are first mixed in a dry state and water is added to make a paste. This plaster should be used within 30 minutes since cement starts setting after 30 minutes. 3. Mud plaster Mud plaster is prepared with equal volumes of clay or brick earth and of chopped straw, hay, loose soil or cowdung and hemp. The ingredients are mixed and left for seven days with large quantity of water. Then, it is again mixed till it reaches the required consistency before using. Mud plaster made of sand and clay can also be used. 4. Waterproof plaster This plaster consists of one part of cement, two parts of sand and pulverised alum at the rate of 12 kg/m3 of sand. In order to make this to be waterproof, soap water containing about 75 gm soap/litre of water is added.",

Plastering in two coats The procedure for carrying out the plastering in cement in two coats is as follows: 1. The mortar joints are raked out to a depth of 20 mm and the surface is cleaned and well watered. 2. If the surface to be plastered is very rough, a preliminary coat is applied. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.56 3. The first coat of plaster is now applied with a thickness of 9 mm to 10 mm for brick masonry. To maintain uniform thickness, screeds are formed on the wall surface by fixing dots. Fixing a dot is just placing small quantity of plaster making a square of 150 mm × 150 mm. Another dot is placed vertically below this and a vertical strip of plaster connecting these two dots is provided. This is a screed. Screeds are placed at a distance of 2 m and plaster is applied between them. 4. The second coat is applied after about 6 hours and the thickness of second coat is about 3 mm to 12 mm. It is finished as per the requirements. 5. The completed work is allowed to set for 24 hours and it is well watered for at least one week. 2.

    "text": "1. Small patches swell out beyond the plane and this is particularly seen inside the building. This is known as blistering of plastered surface. 2. Cracks are formed on the surface which may be visible or invisible. The development of fine hair cracks is known as crazing. 3. Soluble salts are present in plaster materials as well as in building materials. When newly constructed wall drieds out, soluble salts appear as a white crystalline Superstructure 5.57 substance. This is referred to as efflorescence and this effects the adhesion of paint with wall surface. 4. The formation of a very small loose mass on the plastered surface is known as flaking and it is due to the failure of bond between coats of plaster. 5. The plaster from some portion of the surface comes off and a patch is formed. This is known as peeling and is also due to failure of bond in coats of plaster. 6. Sometimes, the plaster may contain particles which expand on setting. A conical hole is formed on the surface which is known as blow or pop. 7. Rust stains are seen on the plastered surface, especially when plaster is applied on metal lath. 8. The excessive dampness at certain points on the surface makes that portion soft. The reasons are, due to the presence of thinners in the finishing coat, presence of deliquescent salts, excessive suction of the undercoat, etc. 9. Uneven surface is due to poor workmanship. 5.10.6 Remedies for Minimising the Defects in plastering Work 1. Workmanship should be the best in brick work and plastering work. 2. Bond of brickwork should be proper. 3. Efflorescence is removed by rubbing brushes on the surface. A solution of 1 part of HCl acid or H2SO4 acid and 5 parts of clean water is prepared and applied on the affected area. The surface is then cleaned with water. The surface is kept under observation for few days. If efflorescence appears again, it is removed and painting can be done only when it ceases. 4. Bricks of superior class should be used. 5. The surface to be plastered should be well watered so that it may not absorb water from the plaster. 6. Excessive trowelling should be avoided. 7. Damp-proof courses should be provided at convenient places in the building. 8. Fresh plastered surfaces should be protected from superfluous quantity of water and excessive heat.",

In general, all properties are classified broadly into two categories: immovable property and movable property. Immovable property includes land, buildings, mines, trees, quarries, etc. Movable property includes things which can be moved from place to place, e.g., coal, oil, building materials such as steel, cement, jelly and sand. Movable properties are otherwise called chattels. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.58 The value of a property is based on principles of economics.

Buying and selling of the properties Whenever one wants to buy or sell a property, one must be aware of the value prevailing in the market at that time. 2. Taxation Tax schedule is prepared based on valuation only. Government taxes such as estate duty, wealth-tax, capital gain tax and gift tax are calculated based on valuation only. 3. Security of loans When loans are to be granted against a property, the valuation of the property has to be carried out. 4. Rent determination In order to determine the probable amount of rent from a property such as a house, valuation is essential. 5. Compulsory acquisition Sometimes a property may be acquired by law and, in that case, the owner of the property has to be paid a suitable compensation. The above is possible through valuation. 6. Speculation Sometimes a person may purchase a property, with a view to develop it in future. To gauge the potential of a property, valuation is necessary. 7. Private development Valuation becomes essential for a property to be purchased by a person with a view to improve it for personal use. 8. Betterment charges When the property comes under some town-planning scheme of the area, its value will increase and consequently, the owner has to pay additional tax known as betterment charges. So, it becomes necessary for the owner to know the value of his property before and after the town-planning scheme execution. 9. Court fees, registration charges When a case has to be filed with respect to a real estate, valuation becomes necessary, to affix the stamp of suitable amount. Similarly for transferring a property, the registration charges are fixed based on the value of property only. 10. Insurance For the purpose of insuring a property, valuation is necessary. 11. Reinstatement The process of reinstating a property needs its current value. Superstructure 5.59",

    "text": "The value of a building depends on the type of the building, its structure, the quality of materials used in the construction, and so on. The value of the building also depends on the place of location, the height of the building, the height of plinth, the thickness of wall, the type of floor, roof, doors and windows, etc. The value also depends on the demand which varies from time to time. While valuing a building, the age of the building should be obtained from the past records. The following methods are used for the valuation of a building: 1. Rental method of valuation In this method, net income by way of rent is determined by deducting the outgoings from the gross rent. Net income = Gross rent – Outgoings Then a suitable interest is assumed and year’s purchase is calculated. Now, the value of the building is obtained as the product of net income and year’s purchase. 2. Direct comparison with capitalised value This method may be adopted if the rental value of a building is not available but the sale price of a similar property is available. The value of the concerned property is fixed in comparison with the value of similar property in the locality. 3. Valuation based on profit This method is suitable for public buildings such as hotels, cinema theatres, auditoriums and music halls for which the value depends on the profit. For the above cases, the value is obtained by multiplying the net profit with the year’s purchase. Net profit = Gross income – Outgoings 4. Valuation based on cost In this approach, the actual cost of the constructed property is found after allowing for necessary depreciation and the resulting figure is taken as the value of the property. 5. Development method of valuation In this method, the anticipated value of a property is obtained by multiplying the net income with the year’s purchase. The property mentioned above includes those which are not at present in good condition, needing additions, alterations, improvements etc. In such a case, the value can be obtained upon anticipating the future net income from it. 6. Depreciation method of valuation It is worth to discuss the above method in detail. Depreciation refers to gradual loss of the value of a property due to wear and tear, excess usage, improper handling, age, etc. Depreciation technique involves collecting or providing an amount equal to the loss due to depreciation every year, separately from the profit. So that, when the property is sold at the end (scrap value) it can be replaced by a new one with the scrap value and the total depreciation amount. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.60 As far as a building is concerned, depreciation method of valuation based on plinth area is a well known one. 7. Area-based valuations (a) plinth-area estimate This estimate is prepared on the basis of plinth area of the building. The plinth area rate is obtained from the cost of similar building having similar specifications, height and construction in the locality. Plinth area is the built-up covered area of a building measured at floor level of any storey. It is calculated by taking the external dimensions of the building at the floor level excluding plinth offsets. Courtyard, open areas, balconies and cantilever projections are not included in the plinth area. The following shall be included in the plinth area: (i) All floors, area of walls at the floor level excluding plinth offsets, if any (ii) Internal shafts for sanitary installations provided if these do not exceed 2 sq.m. in area, air condition ducts, lifts, etc. (iii) The area of barsati and the area of mumty at terrace level (iv) Area of porches other than cantilevers The following shall not be included in the plinth area: (i) Area of loft (ii) Internal sanitary shafts provided if these area more than 2 sq.m. in area (iii) Unenclosed balconies (iv) Towers, turrets, domes, etc., projecting above the terrace level, not forming a storey at the terrace level (v) Architectural bands, cornices, etc. (vi) Sunshades, vertical sun breakers or box louvers projecting out. Approximate cost of the building may be found using the formula: Approximate cost of the building = Total plinth area × Plinth area rate of the building in the locality Approximate area for different types of buildings are given in Table 5.4. Table 5.4 Approximate area of different types of building Type of building Floor area per head Area occupied by wall Residential 2.5 to 3.0 sq.m. 15 to 20% of plinth area School 1.0 to 2.0 sq.m. 15 to 20% of plinth area Hotel 7.0 to 10.0 sq.m. 15 to 20% of plinth area Hospital 8.0 to 10.0 sq.m. 15 to 20% of plinth area Factory 2.5 to 3.0 sq.m. 10% of plinth area Office 2.5 to 3.0 sq.m. 10% of plinth area Superstructure 5.61 (b) Carpet-area estimate Carpet area of the building is the useful area or the livable or lettable area. The carpet area of the building shall be the floor area excluding the following: (i) Sanitary accommodation (ii) Verandah (iii) Corridors and passages (iv) Kitchen and pantries (v) Stores in domestic building (vi) Entrance hall (vii) Staircases and mumties (viii) Shafts for lifts (ix) Barsaties (x) Garages (xi) Canteens (xii) Air-conditioning ducts and rooms The floor area can be determined by deducting the area occupied by the walls from the plinth area. The carpet area of an office building may be 60–70 per cent of the plinth area and that of a residential building may be 50–60 per cent of the plinth area. Illustrative Examples example 5.1 Determine the value of a building if the plinth area is 160 sq.m. using the straight line method of depreciation. Rate of plinth area = Rs 1000/sq.m. Rate of depreciation = 1.25 % per year Period of consideration 10 years. Solution Present value of the building = 1000 × 160 = Rs 1,60,000 Depreciation at the rate of 1.25% for 10 years = 1,60,000 × ( 1.25 ____ 100 ) × 10 = Rs 20,000 Value of the building after allowing the depreciation = Rs 1,60,000 – 20,000 = Rs 1,40,000 example 5.2 Calculate the value of a building if the carpet area of the building is 98 sq. m. Rate of plinth area is Rs 1550/sq.m. and rate of depreciation is 1.2% per annum. The present age of the building is 13 years. Take the carpet area as 70% of the plinth area. Solution Carpet area of the building = 98 sq.m. Carpet area = ( 70 ____ 100 ) × Plinth area Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 5.62 98 = ( 70 ____ 100 ) × Plinth area Plinth area = 98 × ( 100 ____ 70 ) = 140 sq.m. Valuation before depreciation = Rs 1550 × 140 = 2,17,000 Depreciation for 13 years = Rs 2,17,000 × ( 1.2 ____ 100 ) × 13 = 34.852 Value of the building after depreciation = Rs 2,17,000 – 33,852 = Rs. 1,83,148 example 5.3 Calculate the approximate cost of the residential building having a carpet area of 2000 sq.m. Plinth area rate is Rs. 1000/sq.m. Solution Carpet area = 50 to 60% of plinth area Assuming carpet area as 50% of plinth area Plinth area = ( 100 ____ 50 ) × Carpet area Plinth area = 2 × 2000 = 4000 sq.m Approximate cost of the building = Plinth area rate × Plinth area = Rs. 1000 × 4000 = Rs. 40,00,000 example 5.4 Calculate the plinth area, carpet area and floor area for the plan of the building given in . Solution Plinth area = 6.6 × 6.9 = 45.54 sq.m. Floor area = Plinth area – area occupied by walls Area occupied by walls = (2 × 4.2 × 0.3) + (2 × 6 × 0.3) + (2 × 2.7 × 0.2) + (1 × 2.7 × 0.3) + (1 × 2.5 × 0.2) sq.m. = 2.52 + 3.60 + 1.08 + 0.81 + 0.50 sq.m. = 8.51 sq.m Floor area = 45.54 – 8.51 sq.m = 37.03 sq.m Carpet area = Floor area – non-usable area Floor area of verandah = 3.4 × 2.5 = 8.5 sq.m Floor area of Bath and W.C. = 2.5 × 2.5 = 6.25 sq.m Carpet area = 37.03 – (8.50 + 6.25) = 22.28 sq.m example 5.5 The actual expenditure incurred in the construction of a single storey residential building of plinth area 72 m2 is found to be Rs 1,02,600 in which 60% is towards the cost of the materials and the remaining is towards the cost of the labour. It is now proposed to construct a similar building of the same height and specifications with the Superstructure 5.63 plinth area of 94 m2 at a place where the cost of materials is 10% more and the cost of the labour is 20% less. Estimate approximately the cost of the proposed building. Solution Total cost of the existing building = Rs 1,02,600 Plinth area of existing building = 72 m2 Plinth area rate = 1,02,600/72 = Rs 1,425 per m2 Cost of materials = 0.6 × 1425 = Rs. 855 per m2 Cost of labour = 0.4 × 1425 = Rs. 570 per m2 Increase in cost of materials = 10% Decrease in cost of labour = 20% Plinth area rate for the proposed building = (1.1 × 855) + (0.8 × 570) = Rs 1396.50 per m2 Plinth area of the proposed building = 94 m2 Approximate cost = 94 × 1396.50 = Rs 1,31,271 The approximate cost of the proposed building is Rs. 1,31,271. example 5.6 The particulars regarding a two-storeyed building are given below: Plinth area of ground (first) floor = 82 m2 Plinth area of second floor = 68 m2 Expenditure for the construction of ground floor = Rs 1,10,700 Expenditure for the construction of second floor = Rs 80,240 Estimate the probable cost of a similar building proposed to be constructed in the same locality with plinth areas of 96 m2 in ground floor and 80 m2 in second floor. Solution Plinth area rate for ground floor = 1,10,700/82 = Rs 1,350 per m2 Plinth area rate for second floor = 80,240/68 = Rs 1,180 per m2 Probable cost for the proposed building = (96 × 1350) + (80 × 1180) = Rs 2,24,000 The probable cost of the proposed building is Rs 2.24 lakhs.

In times of war, materials are swiftly transported for the defence needs of the country by railroad bridges. Bridges link the whole country with road and railway communication maintaining a uniform flow of people, goods and other essential commodities. The necessity of bridges may therefore be summarised as follows: 1. Bridges enable the free flow of traffic during monsoons and other periods of inclement weather. 2. Bridges provide additional communication facilities. 3. The development of the backward districts which may be rich agriculturally critically depends on the existence of bridges. 4. Bridges provide more socio-economic benefits to the people. 5. Bridges also enable movement of troops and military vehicles during hostilities.",

Reconnaissance is therefore made and the following data are recorded to determine the feasibility of bridge construction: Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 6.2 Considered while selecting the site for a bridge are the following: 1. The bridge should cross the river at right angles to the direction of flow of stream or river water so as to minimise the length of the bridge. 2. The banks on either sides of the river should have firm soil and be straight and well-defined. This will increase the stability of the bridge and reduce the possibility of the erosion of the banks. Also, the soil need not be stabilised or given any other treatment which will increase the cost. 3. The selected site should be at a place where the river is narrow and the flow is streamlined without serious whirls and cross currents. Small width reduces the length of the bridge which means less cost of construction and maintenance. If the flow of water is uniform and parallel, it is a reliable guard against scour. 4. Precautions should be taken to see that the selected site should be far away from where the river is likely to change the course. If the bridge has been constructed and the river has changed its course, the bridge will be rendered useless. 5. Hard inerodable strata or rock should be available close to the river-bed level. 6. There should not be any sharp curves in road approaches.",

    "text": "The engineer in-charge of the investigation for a bridge should collect the following information before the construction of a bridge is undertaken: 1. Volume and Nature of Traffic Not only the present volume and nature of traffic but also the future volume which is expected in the next ten years should be collected. The size and the type of the bridge required depend on this data. 2. Velocity of the Stream and High Flood Level (HFL) Attained The discharge of water passing through the bridge depends on the velocity of water. It will help in designing the proper size of the waterway and pier thickness. The velocity of the stream during high flood and also during normal flow can be determined with the help of the current meter or velocity rods. The High Flood Level (HFL) will enable a bridge engineer to determine the height of free board which is the height of the road way above the HFL. It is necessary to prevent the washing away of the bridge during heavy floods. 3. Catchment Area It is an area of that portion of watershed from which water flows and feeds the river. This is necessary to calculate the discharge of the stream. 4. Strength and Nature of Soil and Extent and Type of Vegetation The depth of foundation for the piers and abutments depends on the strength of soil. This is determined by carrying out borings at several places and testing the soil samples. Extent and type of vegetation along with climatic conditions are also noted. 5. Frequency of Flood Occurrence and Rainfall Details The determination of flood frequency is an important factor as most of the bridges are designed for a flood frequency of 50 years. Amount of rainfall and the HFL are also noted for future design. Bridges 6.3 6. Scour Depth Determination Eroding of the bed of river due to heavy discharge and the velocity of water known as scour has a great bearing on the design of the depth of foundation of piers and abutments. Hence, the extent to which the bed of the river may scour below the HFL is determined according to which the design is made. In addition to the above, the following data should also be collected. 1. Name of the river, road and location of the probable bridge sites 2. Location of the nearest Great Trigonometric Survey (GTS) bench mark with its Reduced Level (RL) 3. Navigational requirements, if any, for the river 4. Availability, quality and location of the nearest quarries for stones, for masonry and for concrete aggregates 5.

    "text": "Figure 6.1 (a) shows the elevation while . Broadly, a bridge can be divided into two major parts: superstructure and substructure. The superstructure of a bridge is analogous to a single-storey building roof and substructure to that of the walls, columns and foundations supporting it. Hand rails Free board Bearing Reinforcement in deck slab Hfl Effective span Abutment Foundation bed Piers .4 River course Bridge length Approach Piers Carriage way Approach Wing wall Rivetment . Thus, handrails, guardstones and flooring supported by any structural system, such as beams, girders, arches and cables, above the level of bearings form the superstructure.  Substructure Substructure is a supporting system for the superstructure. It consists of piers, abutments, wingwalls and foundations for the piers and abutments. The other main parts of a bridge structure are the approaches, bearings and river training works, such as the aprons, and the rivetment for slopes at abutments, etc. Some of the important components of a bridge are explained in this section.  Piers These are provided in between the two extreme supports of the bridge (abutments) and in the bed of the river to reduce the span and share the total load coming over the bridge. Piers are provided with foundation which is taken below the bed of the river where hard soil is available. Abutments The end supports of a bridge superstructure are called abutments. It may be of brick masonry, stone masonry, RCC or precast concrete block. It serves both as a pier and as a retaining wall. The height of abutment is equal to that of the piers. The functions of an abutment are the following: 1. To transmit the load from the bridge superstructure to the foundations 2. To give final formation level to the bridge superstructure 3. To retain earth work of embankment of the approaches Wing Walls The walls constructed at both end of the abutments to retain the earthfilling of bridge approaches are called wing walls. Normally, the wing walls have steadily Bridges 6.5 decreasing cross-section. The design of wing walls is independent. Generally, the water face of these walls is kept vertical. Foundations The lowest artificially built parts of piers, abutments, etc., which are in direct contact with the subsoil supporting the structure are called foundations. The factors which affect the selection of foundation include the type of soil, the nature of soil, the type of the bridge, the velocity of water and the superimposed load on the bridge. Well foundation is the most commonly adopted bridge foundation in India. The foundation may consist of a single large diameter well or a group of smaller wells of circular or other shapes. Approaches These are the lengths of communication route at both ends of the bridge. Approaches may be in embankment or in cutting depending upon the design of the bridge. It is recommended (as per Indian Road Congress) that the approaches must be straight for a minimum length of 16 m on either side of the bridge. Its function is to carry the communication route up to the floor level of the bridge. Hand Rails and Guard Stones Hand rails are provided on both sides of a bridge to prevent any vehicle from falling into the stream. Footpaths are also provided for pedestrians to walk along without interfering with the heavy vehicular traffic. In order to prevent a vehicle from striking the parapet wall or the hand rails, guard stones painted white are provided along the edge of the footpaths at the ends of the road surface. Guard stones are also provided along both sides of the approach roads in filling to prevent the vehicles from toppling over the sides of the embankments. Bearings for the Girders The longitudinal girders have to rest over the piers which bear the thrust of the load coming over them. In order that the girder ends should rest on proper seats, the same are provided with bearing blocks made of cement concrete, so that the load may be uniformly distributed over the structure on which they rest. Due to the expansion and contraction of the longitudinal girders during severe heat and cold, rollers are provided on the abutment ends to allow the movements without causing the girder to buckle.",

    "text": "According to the Expected Utility of Service The bridges are classified as temporary and permanent bridges. 1. Temporary bridges The bridges which are constructed and maintained at low cost and have short span of life are called temporary low cost bridges, e.g., timber bridges. Temporary bridges are constructed in the following cases: (i) During construction of dams (ii) During construction of permanent bridges (iii) For crossing river during melas (iv) During repair work of permanent bridges (v) During survey work for projects (vi) For transporting timber from one bank to the other in forests. These bridges are dismantled when the object of their construction is fulfilled. 2. Permanent bridges These are bridges which are constructed and maintained at high cost and have a long span of life. These bridges are built to last for centuries, e.g., steel bridges and RCC bridges. According to the Position of the Floor of the Bridge Relative to formation level and highest flood discharge, the bridges are classified as deck bridges, through bridges and semi- through bridges. 1. deck bridges When the platform of a bridge, carrying the communication route is supported at the top of the superstructure, i.e., when the superstructure of a bridge is Bridges 6.7 accommodated between the high flood level and the formation level then the bridge is known as the deck bridge which is shown in . 2. Through bridge When the plat- form of a bridge, carrying the communication route is suspended at the bottom of the superstructure, i.e., when the superstructure of a bridge projects completely above the formation level then the bridge is known as through-type bridge (shown in . 3. semi-through Bridge When the superstructure of a bridge projects partly above and partly below the formation level, it is known as semi-through bridge or pony bridge and is thus an intermediate type between deck and through types. Figure 6.4 shows a semi- through bridge. Railings Bridge floor Road Bridge girder Abutment Foundation bed Hfl Formation level .e., direction of flow of water), the bridges are classified as straight bridges and skew bridges. 1. straight bridge The bridge which is at right angles to the axis of flow of water is called straight bridge. This type of crossing is also known as square crossing. 2. skew bridge The bridge which is constructed at some angle other than 90° to the flow of water is known as a skew bridge. It is better to always avoid a skew bridge because it has the following disadvantages: (a) The foundations are likely to be scoured. (b) Construction of skew arches is difficult. (c) Maintenance is costly and difficult. (d) The piers have to resist additional water pressure, as whirls are produced. Hence, special care must be taken to ensure that the pier is parallel to the current. Piers Hfl Formation level Superstructure . 6.3 Through bridge Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 6.8 According to the Position of High Flood Level 1. submersible or low-level bridge It is the bridge which allows the highest flood to pass over its superstructure. These bridges are generally constructed on unimportant routes and when sufficient funds are not available. In this case, storm water runs only for a short period of the year. The stream remains dry for the rest of the year or normal flow runs under the bridge. 2. Non-submersible or high-level bridge It is a bridge which does not allow the high flood water to pass over the floor carrying the communication route. This type of bridge is of permanent nature. It is constructed on important highways and to carry an unobstructed traffic throughout the year. Moreover, sufficient funds should be available for its construction. According to the Type of Superstructure 1. Arch bridges 2. Girder bridges 3. Truss bridges 4. Suspension bridges According to the Method of Providing Clearance in Navigation Channels 1. Movable bridges 2. Transporter bridges According to the Span 1. Culvert (span less than 6 m) 2. Minor bridges (span between 8–30 m) 3. Major bridges (span above 30 m) 4. Long-span bridges (span above 120 m) According to the Loadings Road bridges and culverts have been classified by Indian Road Congress (IRC) into Class AA, Class A and Class B bridges according to the loadings they are designed to carry. According to the Level of Crossing of Highways and Railways 1. Overbridge The bridge constructed to allow a highway to pass over another communication route (railway) is called an overbridge. 2. Underbridge The bridge constructed to allow a road to pass under another communication route is known as an underbridge. According to their Function According to their function or purpose, bridges are classified as 1. Foot bridge 2. Highway bridge 3. Railway bridge 4. Viaduct bridge 5. Aqueduct bridge According to Materials  1. Timber bridge 2. Masonry bridge 3. Steel bridge 4. RCC bridge 5. Prestressed concrete bridge Bridges 6.9 According to the Interspan Relationship 1. Simple bridge 2. Continuous bridge 3. Cantilever bridge Arch Bridge Arch bridges are often used because of their pleasing appearance. These are more graceful and suited for deep gorges with rocky abutments. Arch bridges can be economically adopted up to a span of 250 m. In this type of bridge, the roadway is constructed on an arch which rests on piers and abutments as shown in . An example of an arch bridge is the rainbow bridge across the Niagara river over a span of 290 m. The advantages of an arch bridge are: 1. There will be no bending anywhere in the arch 2. Vibrations due to impact forces are minimum 3. Pleasing appearance Slab Bridge  This is the simplest type of RCC bridge and easiest to construct. Slab bridges are generally found to be economical for a span of up to 9 m. The thickness of the slabs is quite considerable but uniform, thereby requiring simple shuttering. Though the amount of concrete and steel required are more, the construction is much simpler and placement of material is easy. Figure 6.6 shows a slab bridge. T-Beam and Slab Bridge  This consists of T-beams supported over piers and abutments as shown in . The deck slab is supported over the T-bearns. This type of bridge is suitable for spans between 9 – 20 m. A T-beam bridge is cheaper and requires less quantity of materials. For example, the longest RCC T-beam bridge in India is the Advai Bridge in Goa with a pier spacing of 35 m.

The main components here are an arch resembling the bow and a tie beam resembling the string of the bow. As the major portion of the load will be borne by the beam, the thrust on the abutments from the arch will be limited. Hence, the abutments need not be too heavy. The roadway is actually suspended from the arch rib by means of vertical suspenders as presented in . These bridges can be adopted for spans of 30–45 m. Suspension Bridge Superstructure of a suspension bridge consists of two sets of cables over the towers, carrying the bridge floor by means of suspenders as shown in . This bridge is best suited for light traffic for large spans exceeding 600 m. These bridges are flexible and hence the vertical oscillations will be more than the other bridges. The entire load will be borne by the cables which are anchored to the ground. Prestressed Concrete Bridge Prestressed concrete (PSC) which is made up of high strength concrete and high tensile steel has distinct advantages in bridge construction. Prestressed concrete is ideally suited for composite bridge construction in which precast prestressed girders support the cast in situ slab deck. Post tensioned prestressed concrete elements are used for long span bridges. Prestressed concrete is ideally suited for medium and long span bridges. Solid slabs are used for a span ranging from 10 m to 20 m, while T beam slab deck are suitable for spans ranging from 20 m to 40 m. Box Girders are used for large span ranging from 30 m to 70 m. Prestressed concrete is ideally suited for long span continuous bridges exceeding more than 50 m. Prestressed concrete has been widely used throughout the world for simply supported, continuous, cantilever, suspension type bridges in the span range of 20 m to 500 m. Side span Main span Side span Suspenders Cable Stiffening girder Tower . 6.8 RCC bow string girder bridge Bridges 6.11 . They can be classified as follows: 1. Steel truss bridges 2. Steel rigid frame bridges 3. Plate girder bridges 4. Steel arch bridges 5. Steel bow string girder bridges 6. Movable bridges Steel Truss Bridges Steel truss bridges are provided for long railway bridges, as they are less affected by wind pressure. It is easy to erect steel truss bridge since its component members are relatively light in weight. The primary forces in its members are axial forces. Steel truss bridges which are commonly used are the following and are shown in . 1. N-truss bridge 2. K-truss bridge 3. Warren truss bridge 4. Pratt truss bridge 5.

No bearing and fixtures are required in such bridges. These bridges have more clearance below them and heavy abutments are not required. The structure of such a bridge is shown in . .13 Filled earth Steel rigid frame RCC pier Road level Railing Abutment . Hence, they are mainly used for railway bridges. These are used for spans of up to 20 m. In order to increase the lateral stability, box girders which consist of four plates connected by angles are used. Steel Arch Bridges Steel arch bridges are constructed where it is not possible to construct an intermediate pier. It can be used for a very long span, i.e., of up to 150 m. Steel arches may either be of the spandrel-braced or trussed-arch type, as shown in . Web Chord (a) Two Hinged Crescent Arch (b) Truss Type Arches (c) Open spandrel arches .14 Steel Bow-String Girder Bridges In steel bow-string girder bridges, in order to bear horizontal thrust, a steel tie is provided which joins the two ends of an arch. In these bridges, suspenders are provided from the arch-ribs to carry the roadway as shown in . Movable Bridges Movable bridges are constructed in order to provide a headway or opening for navigation ships. The design of the bridge superstructure is done in such a way that it can be moved so as to allow necessary width and clearance for the passing of ships. The following are the common types of movable bridges: 1. Vertical lift bridge 2. Bascule bridge 3. Swing bridge 1. Vertical Lift Bridge In such bridges, the trusses supporting the roadway are vertically lifted up by means of cables operated by electric motors or hydraulic machines. 2. Bascule Bridge Bascule type bridge is one in which the bridge can be opened vertically upwards. The bridge may be of single bascule or double bascule. The railway bridge connecting the Mandapam and Rameswaram island, is of double bascule type. 3. Swing Bridge In the case of swing bridges, the trusses carrying the roadways revolve about a vertical axis whenever required.",

The stored water in the dam can be conveniently used for irrigation purposes. 2. The reservoir forms a very good source for water supply in areas where groundwater source is inadequate. 3. If sufficient head of water is stored, then that can be used for power generation (hydel power). 4. In case of heavy floods, if water is left unobstructed, the result will be very hazardous involving irrecoverable loss of lives of human beings, animals, etc., and loss of property. A dam across the river can act as a good flood-control measure by only letting out the excess quantity of water. 5. A dam with its green surroundings forms an excellent place for recreation purposes such as boating, swimming and water skiing. 6. The reservoir forms a good place for the breeding of fish, which is a considerable wealth from dam. Fish are bred by the pisciculture department. 7. Besides the above-mentioned purposes, a dam serves many miscellaneous purposes, such as adding beauty to the place where it is located and making it a place of tourism importance.

    "text": "The selection of a suitable site for a concrete dam depends on many factors, which are detailed below. Availability and Characteristics of Materials for Construction It is necessary for economic consideration that the materials required for the dam should be available in close vicinity to the site. For a concrete dam, if natural material or good rock for making the aggregates Dams 7.3 is available, it is desirable. If limestone is available nearby, it may be possible to replace Portland cement partially or wholly. Availability of Suitable Site for Construction Facilities The dam site should offer a suitable place for location of colonies, etc. It is necessary to connect the dam site to the nearest rail head by a good road and also if economically feasible, by railway to transport construction machinery, hydromechanical equipment and subsequently for development. Availability of Utility Services It is economical if the site has, in its near vicinity, an access road, electric line, and water supply, etc. Climate Very cold and heavy rainfall will impede the progress of construction activities. Diversion During Construction Sometimes river diversion problems play an important role in the selection of a dam site. This factor may affect the design of the dam and also the construction schedule. Foundation The site should preferably have good sound rock for foundation. For a concrete or masonry dam, solid rock at the surface or within a reasonable depth below it, is essential. For arch dams, strong abutments are essential. Flood Control Aspect The dam site should be above the area to be protected. Availability of Water It is an important factor. Good water availability with minimum fluctuations is a desirable feature. Irrigation Command The dam site should be above the area to be irrigated. Locality Healthy surroundings free from mosquitoes are preferable. Sediment Load An assurance that the dam would not silt soon is a desirable factor. The sediment load in the stream should be as little as possible. Spillway Site In the case of a masonry dam, it is not essential that a good site for spillway be available. If available, it will be advantageous. Submergence The value of the property and land submerged by the proposed dam should be low in comparison to the benefits expected from the dam. For example, the height of Rihand dam in Uttar Pradesh (India) could not be raised as the neighbouring Singarelli coal mines are under danger of being submerged. Topography and Storage Capacity For the economic feasibility of a storage project it is necessary that the length of the barrier or dam should be as small as possible and for a given height, it should store a good volume of water. Hence the river valley at the dam site should be as narrow as possible and should open out upstream to provide a reservoir as shown in .",

    "text": "As the name implies, these dams are constructed using rigid construction materials, such as stone or brick or reinforced cement concrete or plain cement concrete. The basic cross-sectional profile of a rigid dam is triangular as shown in . Various types of rigid dams are discussed below. 1. Solid gravity dams  A gravity dam can be defined as a structure which is designed in such a way that its own weight resists the external forces. This type of dam is more durable and has maximum rigidity. It requires less maintenance when compared to other types. This type can be constructed of masonry or concrete. Nowadays, concrete gravity dams are prevalent. The dam section is massive as the self-weight is the only force which is going to resist all other disturbing forces acting on the dam. Therefore, it needs a good foundation soil, preferably a rocky strata. In practice, a triangular basic profile cannot be adopted and instead this profile is modified to accommodate the operating platform for the shutters and roadway at the top. So a practical profile will be a trapezoidal one with a sufficient free board as shown in . Top width Body of dam Upper supply sluice Infiltration gallery Lower supply sluice D/S side Toe Free board Mwl Reservoir U/S side Heel Reservoir bed Hard foundation rock . 7.2 Basic profile of a dam Dams 7.5 The water stored on the upstream side exerts a major disturbing force on the dam. In addition to this, water may seep through the body of the dam and below the foundation of the dam. This will cause uplift of the dam which also affects the stability of the dam. There are also wave pressure, ice pressure, pressure due to earthquake forces, etc., affecting the stability of the dam. Of the above, pressure due to earthquake is significant and this has been the major cause for serious cracks in several dams. To relieve the uplift pressure in the dam, infiltration gallery is provided within the dam section. This will collect the seeping water and will convey it to greater depth so as not to affect the stability of the dam. The provision of supply sluice controlled by shutters enables the release of required quantity of water to the downstream side. A gravity dam may fail due to overturning, sliding, and crushing at the toe. Generally, a gravity dam will be designed with a higher factor of safety and check will be made for the above possible failures. 2. Arch dams An arch dam is curved in plan with its convex face holding the water as shown in . This structure is less massive when compared to the gravity dam. The force exerted by the stored water on the upstream side will be transferred to the abutments by the arch action. Force due to water U/S side D/S side Strong abutment Reaction at abutment Reaction at abutment . In this case, uplift on the base of the dam has no problem because only abutments are going to bear maximum force. An arch dam will be economical only if the length of the dam is less than its height. Therefore, this is preferable for very great heights. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 7.6 According to the method of construction, arch dams are classified into the following types. (a) Constant-radius arch dam as shown in . A Top width A U-shaped canyon Section on AA . 7.4(c). Centre line qq q q Section . 7.4(d). Dams 7.7 q3 q2 q1 Section . Buttress dam A buttress dam has relatively thin sections when compared to a gravity dam. Generally, it consists of a sloping section, buttresses and a base slab. The sloping membrane (face slab) first takes the water load and transfers it to the buttresses which are at specific intervals. The buttresses in turn transfer the load to the base slab which forms the foundation part of the dam. The important types are the flat slab type/ambursen type and the multiple arch type. In the first case, between two buttresses, RCC slabs (reinforced cement concrete) will be available as detailed in . In the case of an arch buttress dam, the arch action of the slab permits wider spacing of buttresses. Lateral beams called braces or struts will be provided between buttresses along the length of the dam which provide additional strength to the buttresses. G.L. Roadway Buttress Lateral braces Cut-off Base (or) foundation slab Face slab or deck slab .8 The height of buttress dams can be conveniently increased by mere extension of buttresses and face slabs. Buttress dams are less massive and can be constructed where the foundation soil is relatively weak. Enormous space available between buttresses can be advantageously used for installing water-treatment plants and powerhouses. 4. Timber and steel dams Timber dams (shown in . 7.7) are special types which are not generally used for bigger dam sections. A timber dam is generally adopted for temporary requirements to enclose certain work sites or to divert the flow to enable the construction of the main dam. After the main structure is built, generally the timber dam will be dismantled. The height of the dam may be up to 9 metres. Timber dams are rarely made watertight. Steel dams are not common in use. But it is possible to construct the dam with steel up to a height of 15–18 m. The construction of a steel dam may be done similar to the timber dams. Wooden plank Hfl Cross braces Strut T beam G.L. Purlin Concrete fill . 7.7 Section of a steel dam Dams 7.9 7.5.2 Non-rigid Dams Non-rigid dams have a trapezoidal basic profile. Earth dams and rock-fill dams which fall under this category are discussed in this section. 1. Earth dams Earth dams are made of soil with minimum processing using primitive equipment. These are built in areas where the foundation is not strong enough to bear the weight of a gravity dam. As the construction material of this dam is ordinary soil which is cheaply available, the cost of construction will be less than that of a rigid dam. These can be constructed in places of low or moderate rainfall which necessitate only moderate heights for the dam. The three different types of earth dams are described here. (a) Homogeneous embankment type When only one type of material is economically or locally available, such homogeneous embankments are possible. This is the simplest type of an earth dam consisting of a single material throughout the structure. A purely homogeneous type poses the problem of seepage which is not desirable from the stability point of view. Sometimes stones will be pitched over the upstream face of the dam to safeguard the dam against wave action and to improve the stability as shown in . Free board Hfl D/S side Line of saturation Rivetment Bed level . 7.9. Normally, inner zone will be of clay or silt or a mixture of both and the outer zone is of locally available soil. The presence of inner impervious zone provides added strength and reduces seepage of water through the dam section. This type can be adopted for dams of greater heights. A suitable filter medium in the form of transition filter combined with toe filter is provided. The provision of above filters will ensure proper collection of the water seeping through the dam section and conveyance of the collected water to the downstream side safely adds to the stability of the dam. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 7.10 Free board Hfl D/S side Line of saturation Rivetment Bed level . 7.10. The thin core is called the diaphragm and is usually made of impervious soils or concrete or steel or timber. The diaphragm must be tied to the bed rock or to a very impervious foundation material. Pervious Hfl B.L. B.L. Stone pitching Stratum Diaphragm Impervious stratum . Rock-fill dams Rock-fill dams are made of loose rocks and boulders piled in the river bed. A slab of reinforced concrete is often laid on the upstream face to make it water tight. These are more stable than earthen dams and less stable than gravity dams. The dam section generally consists of dry rubble stone masonry on the upstream side and loose rock-fill on the downstream side as shown in . Dams 7.11 Hfl Stone masonry Impervious membrane Rock fill 1.5:1 Cut-off . It has better resistance towards earthquakes because of its flexible nature. The structural design of this type of dam is bit complicated when compared to other types.",

Durability It is highly durable and requires minimum maintenance. 3. Height of the Dam It can be constructed of any height, provided a suitable foundation is available to withstand the loads on it. 4. stability It is relatively stronger and more stable than earth dama. 5. Use A gravity dam is most suited at sites with narrow gorges or valleys and steep side slopes. It is adopted for use as an overflow dam. 6. No sudden Failure Failure of the gravity dam, if any, may not suddenly occur. Disadvantages 1. Rock Foundation A gravity dam can be constructed only on sound rock foundations. 2. Causes of Failure A gravity dam may fail due to overturning or sliding or crushing, due to the heavy self-weight of the dam and the forces acting on it. 3. Raising the Height Unless specific provision is made in the initial design itself, it will be very difficult to raise the height of the dam subsequently. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 7.12 4. Initial Cost Initial cost is higher than that of earth dams. 5. skilled Labour Skilled labour is required for its construction. Advantages of Arch Dam 1. The arch dam is suitable for narrow valleys or gorges. 2. The arch dam requires less construction materials and is hence less massive. Saving in the quantity of concrete is around 50% compared to gravity dam. This is because of its better structural effectiveness. 3. When the height of the dam is more than its length, an arch dam is economical. Therefore, this dam is preferable for very great heights. Advantages of R.C.C. Buttress Dam 1. Stability Weight of water on the inclined face slab helps to maintain the stability of the dam. Because of this, the requirement of quantity of concrete becomes less. Thus, the dead weight of the dam is reduced. 2. Weak soil As the dead weight of the dam is less, it may be constructed in weak soil, where hard or rocky stratum is not available. 3. Height of the dam The height of a buttress dam can be easily increased by simply extending the buttress and the face slabs. 4. Lateral beams( braces) The braces add to the strength of the buttress. 5. Space between Buttress The space available between the buttress is very large. It may be used for housing water–treatment plants and power houses. Advantages of Embankment Earth Dams 1. Embankment earth dams are suited to a wide variety of foundation conditions. 2. They are suitable for both steep gorges and wide valleys. 3. Local materials can be made use of. 4. Reduced cost of construction. 5. About 80% of the total number of dams in the world are earth dams.",

    "text": "In the construction of dams, geology plays a vital role in site selection. The first consideration in all sites for a dam is the suitability of the rock in foundations. The main geological considerations in the selection of dam sites are as follows. (i) The underlying rocks must be strong enough to withstand the weight of the dam and the resultant thrust. (ii) The rocks should be sufficiently impervious to prevent seepage of water beneath the sole of the dam. (iii) The rocks should be free from fissures, joints and faults so that there is no leakage of water. Dams 7.13 Sites which have an impervious band of strong massive rocks, free from joints throughout the length of the dam, are considered to be the best site for a dam. Granite which is free from joints and fissures would make an excellent foundation for any dam. When a river breaks across a ridge by cutting a deep gorge at right angles to the strike off the bedded or foliated rocks, an ideal dam site may be found in the gorge. In case of loose, unconsolidated strata like sand and loam where there is considerable loss by percolation or leakage, high dams cannot be efficiently constructed. In such areas, it is possible to construct low-pressure dams if they have sufficiently wide foundations without openings or crevices. Across the fault plane it is not advisable to construct any dam. Rocks having small fissures and joints can be sealed with concreting material but still it is not reliable during earthquakes. Massive solid rocks such as granite, quartzite, limestone and sandstone make excellent sites for the foundation of dams, if they are free from open joints and fissures. Decomposed rocks such as dolerite and laterite should be avoided, as there is a possibility of percolation of water. Short-Answer Questions 1. Distinguish rigid dams from non-rigid dams. 2.

An atom is the smallest particle of an element. According to Dalton’s theory, an atom cannot be split. But this theory is no longer valid. Nuclear Fission Contrary to the Dalton’s Atomic Theory, it has now been established that a large amount of heat energy is derived by fissioning of the nucleus of a fissionable material like uranium U235.

About 0.9 neutron is captured by U235 which gets converted into fissionable material PU239 and about 0.6 neutrons is partly absorbed by the moderator and a part escapes from the reactor. PU239 is a fissionable material and is called secondary nuclear fuel.

The nuclear reaction and thereby the temperature is controlled by moderators. The coolant used here is water which absorbs the heat produced in the reactor. Water evaporates and steam is generated in the reactor itself. In this type of power plant, there is no need for a separate boiler. The steam produced in the reactor is used to run the turbine coupled with a generator from which we get the electrical power. The steam after expansion in the turbine is condensed in the condenser. The condensate after getting heated in several feed water heaters is pumped again into the reactor by means of a feed pump.

They have limited application in marine engines. Gas turbines have the unique advantage of using any type of fuel, i.e., solid, liquid or gas. Gas turbines operate either on an open cycle or in a closed cycle. 8.5.1 working of an open-Cycle single-stage gas Turbine A simple open-cycle gas turbine is represented in . It consists of a compressor, a combustion chamber and a turbine. The compressor and turbine are connected by a common shaft with a suitable flange. Air from the atmosphere is taken and compressed to a pressure ratio ranging from 2 – 8 before passing to the combustion chamber where the fuel is injected. The fuel burns and the temperature is raised at constant pressure. Then, it passes to the turbine where it expands to its original pressure before being exhausted to the atmosphere. A major portion of the power developed in the turbine is used to drive the compressor and the remainder is available as the net power output.

Less vibration. Disadvantages of Gas Turbines 1. There is high operating temperature in the combustion chamber and in the turbine. So, we need special high-temperature alloys. 2. Thermal efficiency is very low in the case of simple gas turbine due to high temperature of about 450°C in the waste exhaust gases. So, a single-stage gas turbine is not suitable for electric-power generation. 3. It exudes high-pitch noise due to very high speed in the order of 50,000 rpm. 4. Gas turbines are not suitable for low capacity. In the world market, experimental gas turbines are available operating on a single stage giving an output of 45 kW. Such a turbine can only give the maximum thermal efficiency of about 6 per cent. 5. Large-size exhaust duct due to increased requirement of air for combustion and also for cooling.

Instead of burning the fuel directly in the air steam, an externally fired combustion chamber or furnace is used and heat is transferred to the working medium through a heat exchanger as in . Thus, the working medium is uncontaminated by the products of combustion and is constantly recirculated. A cooler is provided for the recirculated working medium before it enters the low-pressure compressor in order to minimise the compressor work. Similarly, an intercooler is also provided to improve the overall efficiency of compression. As a multistage turbine is used, the temperature of exhaust gases leaving the turbine is considerably reduced resulting in a higher thermal efficiency. The regenerator preheats the gas before entering the furnace. By these provisions, the thermal efficiency is further increased to about 30 per cent.

A pelton wheel is used at Pykara Power House where a head of more than 900 m is available. The turbine is named after Lester A Pelton (1829–1908), an American engineer, who developed it in about 1880. Figure 8.8(a) shows the Pelton wheel installation. The runner consists of a circular disc with large number of buckets or blades fixed on its periphery. The buckets have the shape of a double semi-ellipsoidal cup. These buckets are made by cast steel, bronze or stainless steel. Water can be controlled by rotating the hand wheel by moving the spear in the case of a small unit. In bigger units, it will be controlled automatically by a governor. The casing is made of cast iron or fabricated steel plates. 2. Francis Turbine It is a mixed-flow type reaction turbine. It is used for medium heads ranging from 50–400 m. Francis turbine is used at the Periyar Hydroelectric Project where a head of about 374 m is available. The main components are a spiral casing, guide blades and a runner as shown in . This turbine was developed by the American Engineer JB Francis in 1849. Water from the penstock pipe enters the casing and flows radially towards the centre of the runner. The casing is usually made of steel. The water is guided to the runner by guide vanes. Guide vanes are made of steel or stainless steel. The runner consists of a series of curved vanes numbering 16 to 24. The vanes are so shaped that water enters the runner radially and leaves it axially. It is usually made of mild steel or stainless steel. 3. Kaplan Turbine Kaplan turbine is an axial flow reaction turbine. The German engineer V Kaplan developed this turbine in 1916. This is suitable for low heads ranging from 1.5 m. It is similar to the Francis turbine in construction, except for the runner. The runner has only 3, 4 or 6 blades. The four blades or vanes are shown in .

Nuclear power plants, thermal power plants, chemical conversion plants, etc., also emit solid, liquid and gaseous pollutants in the environment. The gaseous pollutants cause global environmental problems like global warming and greenhouse effect. Some important environmental constraints of power generation are given below. (i) Particulate Matter Solid or liquid particles present in the air are called particulate matter. Their size varies from 100 nm and 2.5 µm. Dust and fly ash emitted from the power plants are the significant sources of particulate matter in air. (ii) Acid Rain, Acid Snow, Acid Fog and Dry Acidic Deposition Increased concentrations of sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere cause these global environmental effects. (iii) Greenhouse Effect A greenhouse has transparent glass panes, which allow sunlight to enter and prevent exit of heat, CO2 and moisture. The climate inside the greenhouse is warm due to high concentration of CO2 and moisture. A similar effect is created by higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and is called the greenhouse effect. (iv) Global Warming The warming up of earth due to the greenhouse effect is called global warming. In this process, CO2 in the air allows the entry of radiation heat of sunlight, which contains short waves and visible portion of the spectrum.

This cover will permit the radiation from the sun on to the metal plate since it is at a shorter wavelength. When the radiation strikes the plate, a part of the energy is reflected back to the cover. As the radiation is at a higher wavelength, it will not go out to the atmosphere. Instead, the cover will reflect the energy back to the absorber plate and thereby increase the heat transfer. If there is no transparent cover, the reflected energy would have been lost. If the circulating fluid is water, the hot water can be collected in a tank and recirculated. A small water-circulating pump can also be introduced at the inlet side of the collector. Such a system gives a better result due to improved heat transfer.

Most of the electricity is generated from coal, leading to the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2 which contribute to global warming. The world is trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto Summit on Climate Change in 1997 and the ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in 1998. Today, the use of solar energy for power generation is getting intense attention, because it is eco-friendly. At present, the cost of converting solar power into electricity may be high, but it is expected to come down in future. Recently, a British company has developed a system which uses fixed concave mirrors to trap and concentrate the solar energy which heats the air to about 1000°C. This hot air in turn drives a gas turbine generating electricity. One such system built on the Mediterranean island of Crete employs 800 m2 of mirrors fixed at ground level producing 35 kW of power. This system can be installed in remote villages, hospitals and hotels. It can also be used to desalinate water for air-conditioning and cooking. The direct conversion of solar energy into electricity is made possible by using the photovoltaic effect in certain materials. The basic unit of photovoltaic system is the solar cell. The first practical solar cell was produced in 1954 by Bell Telephone Laboratories in USA. This cell was made from a single crystal silicon. A solar cell is a semiconductor device processed and fabricated in a manner which permits the generation of voltage when light falls on it. The voltage is capable of driving an electric current through an external circuit. The power from the solar cells can be used for the operation of a calculator, pump set, radio station, TV station, satellite, etc. The power obtained in the day time can be stored in solar batteries. At present, the cost per unit power is quiet high which can be expected to come down in the future. 8.9.1.3 Solar Power Plant using Butane Boiler Water in the flat-plate collector is heated from 70 to 80°C due to solar radiation. The hot water heats the butane liquid in the butane boiler. As butane vaporizes at 50°C, water at 70 to 80°C is able to vaporize butane. Hot water after transfering the heat to butane is pumped by a circulating pump to the flat-plate collector where it is again heated. Solar radiation Butane turbine Generator Condenser Butane boiler Feed pump Circulating pump Flat plate collector  Solar power plant using butane boiler Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 8.18 Butane vapour from the boiler is taken to the butane turbine which is connected to an electric generator. Exhaust vapour from the turbine is condensed in a condenser and the liquid butane is pumped by a feed pump to the butane boiler. The cycle will be repeated. Advantages of Solar Power Plant 1. Heat energy from the sun is freely available so there is no pollution problem. 2. No transport and storage problem of any fuel. 3. Easy to construct and erect. Disadvantages 1. Solar energy is not available during night. 2. Power produced is rather small.",

The rotor speed has to be stepped up when it is connected with rotor dynamic pumps. The excess water pumped can be stored in overhead tanks and can be used in nonwindy periods. The tailvane helps the blades to change in the direction of wind. Anemometer can indicate the velocity of wind. A modern application of windmill water-pumping operation involves pumping water under high pressure to irrigation sprinklers.

    "text": "The rise and fall of tides in an estuary (river mouth into which the tide flows from the sea) can be made use of to drive specially designed low-head water turbines. These turbines can operate even at very low heads as 0.5 m. Several tidal power plants already exit in many parts of the world. At the mouth of the Rance river in France, a tidal plant with a capacity of 240 MW is producing electricity for commercial use since 1966. India’s first tidal power plant, the Kachchh Tidal Power Project, the biggest project of its kind in the world, is to be built at Navlakhi near Kandla port in Gujarat. The expected power to be generated in this project is about 850 MW from 34 generating sets of 25 MW each. As per the estimate in 1991, the cost of the project is about Rs 1150 crore.

A basin is the area where water is retained by the barrage. A tidal power scheme can have a single basin or multiple basins. Low-head reversible water turbines are installed in the barrage separating the sea from the basin. The electric generator and a number of turbine components are enclosed in a water-tight bulb, with the whole hydroelectric unit submerged in water.

    "text": "Geothermal power plants derive energy from the heat of the earth’s interior. The average increase in temperature with depth under the earth is 1°C for every 30–40 m. At a depth of 10–15 km, the earth’s interior is as hot as l000–1200°C. In certain areas of our planet, the underground heat has raised the temperature of water to over 200°C which bursts out as hot steam through the cracks in the earth’s crust. These are called thermal springs. This steam can be used for the generation of electric power. Boreholes are normally sunk with a depth up to 1000 m releasing steam and water at temperatures ranging from 200–300°C and pressure up to 30 bar. Steam is transmitted by pipelines to the power station. Due to low steam pressure, the station efficiency is only 10 to 15 per cent. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 8.22 In New Zealand, geothermal power plants account for 40 per cent of the total electric output, and in Italy for 6 per cent. Several installations for output, up to about 20 MW are in use in various parts of the world, but the chief installations are the 500 MW station near Lardarele, Italy, and the 250 MW station at Wairaki, New Zealand. Even in India, hot springs are available. Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh and Pugger Valley in Jammu and Kashmir have good potential for generation of energy. These areas have been surveyed and recommended for the installation of geothermal power plants with a capacity of 25 MW.  Schematic diagram of a geothermal power plant 8.9.5 ocean Thermal energy Conversion (oTeC) The heat contained in the ocean could be converted into electricity by utilising the temperature difference of 20–25 K between the warm water on the surface and the cold water at a depth of about 600 m. The high temperature of surface water could be used to heat some low-boiling organic fluid, the vapour of which could run a heat engine. The exit vapour would be condensed by pumping cold water from the deeper regions. The amount of energy available for ocean thermal power generation is enormous. The first OTEC plant was built by the Frenchman Georges Claude in 1929 at the Mantanzas Bay in Cuba. The warm surface water was at 25°C. The cold water at 11°C was tapped by a long pipe. As the Claude plant used an open cycle in early times, the open cycle system is sometimes referred to as ‘Claude cycle’. In the open cycle, the condensate need not return to the evaporator. A schematic diagram of the open cycle OTEC system is shown in . Power Plants, Gas Turbines and Alternate Sources of Energy 8.23 Vacuum pump Dissolved gases out Steam turbine Generator Flash evaporator Condenser Water out Cold water Water out Warm water in Dearator  Schematic diagram of an open-cycle OTEC system 8.9.5.1 Open-Cycle OTEC System The open cycle uses sea water as the working fluid. The warm water is first sent to the deaerator where the dissolved gases are removed by means of a vacuum pump. Then, the warm water is flash evaporated under a partial vacuum in the flash evaporator. This process produces low pressure water vapour / steam, which will be the working fluid in the OTEC system. The low pressure steam is then passed through a turbine which extracts energy from it and runs a generator. The vapour, after expansion in the turbine, is then cooled in the spray condenser (direct contact) is used where the condensate is mixed with the cooling water, and the mixture is discharged into the ocean. It is to be noted here that since we have to obtain energy from low-pressure steam, extremely large-sized turbines must be used. The cost of an open-cycle system for producing electric power is significantly greater than that of a closed-cycle system. The turbine cost alone amounts to almost half the cost of the entire power system.",

    "text": "The first published work on OTEC by d’ Arsonvol in 1881 actually suggested a closed cycle and that article proposed sulphur dioxide as the working fluid. Later, in the closed cycle, working fluids such as ammonia, propane or freon with higher vapour pressures at the temperatures available were used. The most recent design on the closed-cycle OTEC system was done by Anderson and Anderson in the l960s. Hence, the closed cycle is sometimes referred to as ‘Anderson cycle’. They used propane as the working fluid, with a 20°C temperature difference between the warm surface and cold water. The cold water was taken from a depth of about 600 m. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 8.24 Roughly, 14 per cent of the gross power was expected to be consumed internally. The size of the plant was gigantic. A schematic diagram of the closed cycle OTEC power plant is shown in . In boilers and condensers, extensive areas are needed to transfer significant amounts of heat due to low temperature differences. In other words, large volumes of water must be circulated through the OTEC power plant, requiring large heat exchangers.  Schematic diagram of a closed-cycle OTEC power plant The warm water from the surface of the sea is pumped into the boiler where it loses its heat to the propane and is discharged out. The propane gets vaporized and is expanded in the turbine coupled to a generator producing the electrical power. The vapour after expansion is condensed in the surface condenser by means of cool deep-sea water. The condensed propane is again sent to the boiler by means of a pump. Recent development of OTEC systems In the international scenario, large number of countries have recently been active in OTEC research and development. These include Japan, Sweden, Germany and Netherlands. 8.9.6 magneto Hydro dynamic (mHd) Power generator A magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator is a magnetohydrodynamic device that transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy into electricity. MHD generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they operate at high temperatures without moving parts. Power Plants, Gas Turbines and Alternate Sources of Energy 8.25 MHD generator system is a non-conventional source of energy which is based upon Faraday’s law of Electromagnetic Induction. It consists of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some non-conductive material. MHD generator, like a conventional generator, relies on moving a conductor through a magnetic field to generate electric current. The MHD generator uses hot conductive plasma (gas in the range of 2000 to 3000°C), as the moving conductor. It may be noted that when the gas temperature is reduced to less than 2000°C, the conductivity of the gas is totally lost. So, the MHD generator can’t function. When an electrically conductive fluid flows through the tube, in the presence of a significant perpendicular magnetic field, a charge is induced in the field, which can be drawn off as electrical power by placing the electrodes on the sides at 90 degree angles to the magnetic field. The amount of power that can be extracted is proportional to the cross sectional area of the tube and the speed of the conductive flow.  Principle Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Power Generation MHD generators use coal or natural gas. MHD acts like a topping cycle, a combined cycle, to increase the efficiency of electric generation. Hot exhaust gas of an MHD generator can heat the boiler of a steam power plant or gas turbine plant, increasing the overall efficiency. Short-Answer Questions 1.

Steam Boilers and Steam Turbines 9.3 The fire brick layer prevents the over-heating of the boiler shell. The hot gases pass through a large number of fire tubes and heat the surrounding water and convert it into steam. Since the steam is lighter, it goes up to the steam space. The fire tubes normally have 62.5 mm external diameter and are 165 in number. The crown of the boiler shell and grate are both hemispherical in shape.

The rate of combustion and the amount of steam generated is controlled by the dampers. The fire brick arch deflects the hot gases and improves the combustion efficiency. The hot gases pass through large number of fire tubes and enter the smoke box. The circulation of air and hot gases is improved by means of induced draft produced in the smoke box. Waste steam from the engine enters the smoke box through the blast pipe and expands. Due to the expansion, it produces a partial vacuum which improves the movement of hot gases and air. Waste gases go out through a short chimney. A door is provided in the smoke box for inspection and cleaning. To remove the moisture from the wet steam and to increase the temperature of steam, it is superheated as shown as . The wet steam through the regulator enters the wet steam header and passes through large number of superheated tubes and finally comes to the superheater header. Then, the superheated steam goes to the engine. To accommodate the superheater tubes, some of the fire tubes are larger in diameter. There are about 157 fire tubes of 47.5 mm diameter and 24 fire tubes of 130 mm diameter. By superheating, the heat energy per unit mass of steam is increased and the thermal efficiency of the steam plant is considerably increased.

    "text": "It should be remembered that the thermal efficiency of any heat engine is rather low in the range of 15 to 35 per cent. When a heat engine is not able to convert all the input heat energy into useful mechanical power, it would be obviously rejecting energy as waste heat. So, a system will become more efficient if the waste heat is utilised for some useful purpose. Any scheme which combines electrical power generation with utilisation of heat for industrial processes and/or space heating is referred to as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) or Cogeneration. In such a scheme, energy wastage is reduced to the minimum thereby increasing the overall thermal efficiency. Refer to . This cogeneration power plant employs both the steam turbine and a gas turbine for generating electric power. Because of recovery of heat from the flue gases of the boiler and the exhaust gases from the gas turbine, we obtain high overall thermal efficiency. Steam is generated at high pressure and temperature in the boiler. Steam from the boiler is fed to the main steam turbine for generating electric power and also to a small turbine which drives the feed water pump. Both the turbines are back pressure, non-condensing type and the steam in the last stages of the turbines is fed into the desalination plant to purify sea water for getting soft water. Thus, it is noted that the desalination plant is operated by using the heat from the exhaust or waste steam from the turbines. Steam Boilers and Steam Turbines 9.13 . The hot exhaust from the gas turbine is made to heat the condensate feed water from the desalination plant. The above two waste heat recoveries help in increasing the thermal efficiency of the power plant by reducing the fuel burnt in the gas turbine combustion chamber and also in the boiler for the same output power. To site an example, in the case of a gas turbine power plant, heat from the exhaust gases could be made use of in the waste heat recovery boiler. Even after this, the gases could then be passed through an economiser to preheat the feed water for the boiler. Nowadays, this principle is made use of in many ways in thermal plants.",

Let L be the length of the stroke of piston, A be the cross-sectional area of the piston, and N be the number of revolutions, per minute of the crank. Then, The discharge of water per stroke = LA and discharge of the pump per second, Q = LAN/60 If the pump is a double acting reciprocating pump, the discharge is taken to be double the discharge than that of a single acting pump (if the size of the piston rod is neglected). This is due to the reason that, in a double acting pump, the water is sucked on one side of the piston and delivered from the other side during the same stroke. These two processes (i.e., suction on one side and delivery from the other) are reversed during the return stoke. If the size of the piston rod is neglected, then discharge of a double acting reciprocating pump can be calculated as follows: the discharge of the pump per second, Q = 2LAN/60 Slip of the Pump  One of the important terms in estimating the discharge of reciprocating pumps is the Slip of the pump. The discharge of a single acting and double acting reciprocating pumps can be obtained from the equations given above. But in practice, the actual discharge is less than the theoretical discharge.

So, after priming, the impeller will be immersed in water inside the casing. When the impeller is rotated by an electric motor or an engine, it will produce centrifugal force due to which kinetic energy or velocity energy will be produced in the water. This is finally converted into pressure energy due to which water is pumped up, as explained further. 10.4.2 Casing The casing surrounds the impeller. The area between the impeller and casing is gradually increasing, till the delivery pipe. Due to this, the velocity of flow of water will be gradually decreased.

    "text": "Cavitation is the formation of bubbles or cavities in liquid, developed in areas of relatively low pressure around an impeller. The collapsing of these bubbles trigger intense shockwaves inside the pump, causing significant damage to the impeller and/or the pump housing. Cavitation may be classified in ways as follows: Suction Cavitation When a pump is operating under low pressure or vacuum conditions, suction cavitation occurs. The pump is not receiving enough flow of fluid. Cavitation is indicated by formation of bubbles, which may lead to the formation of cavities at the eye of the impeller. As the bubbles carry over to the discharge side of the pump, the fluid conditions change, compressing the bubble into liquid and causing it to implode against the face of the impeller. The cavitation affected impeller will have small and large pits and will look like a sponge. Possible causes of suction cavitation are (i) Clogged filters or strainers, (ii) Blockage in the pipe, (iii) Pump is running too far right on the pump curve and (iv) Poor piping design. Discharge Cavitation If a pump’s discharge pressure is extremely high, or runs at less than 10% of its best efficiency point (BEP), discharge cavitation may occur. The high discharge pressure makes it difficult for the fluid to flow out of the pump, so it circulates inside the pump. Liquid flows between the impeller and the housing at very high velocity, causing a vacuum at the housing wall and the formation of bubbles. The implosion of those bubbles trigger intense shockwaves, causing premature wear of the impeller tips and pump housing. As the worst case, discharge cavitation can cause the breakage of the impeller shaft. Possible causes of discharge cavitation are (i) Blockage in the pipe on discharge side, (ii) Clogged filters or strainers, (iii) Running too far left on the pump curve and (iv) Poor piping design.

    "text": "Heat engines convert heat energy to mechanical energy. The engines use heat obtained by burning some fuel. As the source of heat energy from combustion of a fuel, engines are classified as External Combustion (EC) engines and Internal Combustion (IC) engines. In the EC engines, combustion of the fuel takes place outside the engine and in the IC engines, combustion of the fuel takes place inside the engine. Popular External Combustion (EC) engines are the steam engines that are used in locomotives and ships. Petrol engines and diesel engines are classified as internal combustion engines, abbreviated as IC engines. These engines have extensive applications in transport by road, rail, sea and air. These are made use of in motorcycles, scooters, cars, buses, lorries, railway engines, ships and aero engines. IC engines have made a major revolution in transport. These engines have also contributed to the development of agriculture through tractors, harvesters, etc. IC engines also play a vital role in major construction work through bulldozers and other equipment. Thus, development of IC engines has made a great contribution to human comfort and to the tremendous progress of agriculture and industry. It is surprising and rather unbelievable that about 120 years back, there was no IC engine at all in any part of the world. Obviously, due to the rapid development in science and technology in the recent years, the present generation enjoys more comfort than our ancestors. But, the world is going to face a crisis for fuel in about 50 years when the crude oil in the Gulf countries is expected to be exhausted. Under these circumstances, leading automobile companies in the world are investing huge amounts in research and development to find alternate source to replace diesel and petrol.",

Piston Spark plug or injector Exhaust valve Cylinder head Piston pin Valve rod Cam Connecting rod Locus of crank pin Crank shaft Crank case Crank Crank pin Cylinder Scraper ring Piston rings Inlet valve .3 1. Cylinder The cylinder allows the piston to move to and fro. The cylinder is made of cast iron or steel or an aluminium alloy. Sometimes, a liner made of alloy cast iron is inserted into the cylinder which can be replaced when worn out. 2. Cylinder Head It is fitted on the top of the cylinder. A gasket is provided between the cylinder and the cylinder head to prevent the leakage of hot gases. The cylinder head also accommodates the inlet valve, the exhaust valve, and the spark plug or injector. 3. Piston It transmits the force exerted by the burning gases to the connecting rod and finally to the crank shaft. The piston is usually made of cast iron or steel or aluminium alloy. There is an interesting and complex science behind the design and manufacture of a piston of an IC engine. The diameter of a piston in a large marine engine is about 1 m. 4. Piston Rings Two different types of piston rings are housed in the circumferential grooves provided on the outer surface of the piston. The function of upper rings known as compression rings is to provide gas-tight sealing to maintain the compression pressure inside the cylinder and to prevent the leakage of burnt gases into the crank case. The function of the lower rings is to scrap the used lubricating oil into the crank case. These rings are called scraper rings. 5. Connecting Rod This transmits the force from the piston to the crank shaft. It also helps in converting the reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotary motion of the crank shaft. For the lubrication of the piston pin in the connecting rod, a small hole is provided from the big end to the small end. The small end of the connecting rod is attached to the piston by a gudgeon pin. 6. Crank Shaft Great care should be taken in the proper design of the crank shaft. Alloy steels are used for the crank shaft to withstand the high stress and strain. The crank shaft is provided with suitable holes to help in the lubrication system. The crank case serves as a sump for the lubricating oil. 7. Flywheel It is mounted on the crank shaft. The flywheel stores the excess energy during the power stroke of the engine and helps the movement of the piston during the remaining idle strokes. 8. Cams Properly designed cams control the opening and closing of the inlet and exhaust valves in the case of four-stroke engines. Cams are rotated by a cam shaft driven by the crank shaft through gears. slot slot Compression ring Scrapper ring .4 9. Compression Ratio The compression ratio is defined as VS + VC _______ Vc where Vs is the stroke volume, and Vc is the clearance volume. This is further explained by the following example.  Stroke is the length covered by the piston’s movement from TDC to BDC or in 180 degree turn, of the crank shaft. It is also the diameter of the crank. A motorcycle has a cylinder diameter of 4.6 cm and a stroke of 4.2 cm. If the clearance volume is 12.2 cc, determine the compression ratio r. Stroke volume = Pd2 ___ 4 × l = P (4.6)2 _______ × 4.2 = 67.8 cc The compression ratio r = Vs + Vc _______ Vc = 67.8 + 12.2 __________ 12.2 = 6.552 11.4 Working Of A Four-Stroke Petrol Engine  Figure 11.2 depicts the working of a typical four-stroke petrol engine. The different strokes are described in this section. 1. Suction Stroke During this stroke, the inlet valve is kept opened and the exhaust valve is closed. The piston comes down to the bottom dead centre (BDC) from the top dead centre (TDC). Pressure in the cylinder will be slightly less than the atmospheric Tdc Bdc (b) Compression stroke Inlet valve : Exhaust valve : CLOSED Closed Inlet valve Exhaust valve Tdc Bdc Inlet valve : Opened Exhaust valve : CLOSED (a) Suction stroke Air .) IC Engine 11.5 pressure. Petrol–air in the correct proportion from the carburetter is drawn inside the engine cylinder through the inlet valve. 2. Compression Stroke In this stroke, both the inlet and exhaust valves are kept closed. The mixture of petrol–air is compressed when the piston moves up to TDC. The compression ratio varies from 7–10 for petrol engines. The ratio between the cylinder volume before compression to the volume after compression is known as the compression ratio. At the end of the compression stroke, a spark is produced at the spark plug due to which combustion starts resulting in high pressure and temperature which are comparatively less than that of a diesel engine. 3. Working or Power Stroke During this stroke, both valves are kept closed. The piston is pushed down from TDC to BDC. The force above the piston is transmitted to the crank shaft through the connecting rod and crank mechanism. Excess energy due to the combustion is stored in the flywheel which helps for the operation of three idle strokes. 4. Exhaust Stroke During the stroke, the exhaust valve is kept opened and the inlet valve is kept closed. The piston moves up from BDC to TDC. The waste gases are sent out through the exhaust valve and the cycle is repeated. This is also called scavenging. During these four strokes, the crank shaft will make two revolutions. The thermal efficiency of a four-stroke engine is higher compared to a two-stroke cycle engine. Most of the cars operate on a 4-stroke cycle. Spark plug Tdc Bdc Inlet valve : Exhaust valve : CLOSED Closed (c) Power stroke Tdc Bdc (d) Exhaust stroke Inlet valve : Closed Exhaust valve : OPENED .6 .7 11.5 Working Of A Four-Stroke Diesel Engine  This is similar to the operation of a 4-stroke petrol engine (refer to the earlier sketch). Instead of petrol-air mixture, only air is sucked from the atmosphere during the suction stroke. In a diesel engine, there is no need for a spark plug. Diesel engines are also called compression ignition engines. Dr Rudolf Diesel who invented the compression ignition engine was born in 1858. 1. Suction Stroke During this stroke, the inlet valve is kept opened and the exhaust valve is closed. The piston comes down to the bottom dead centre (BDC) from the top dead centre (TDC). Pressure in the cylinder will be slightly less than the atmospheric pressure. Air is drawn inside the engine cylinder through the inlet value. 2. Compression Stroke In this stroke, both the inlet and exhaust valves are kept closed. The air is compressed when the piston moves up to TDC. The compression ratio varies from 15 – 20 for diesel engines. Due to high compression, higher temperature is obtained in the range of 550°C. At this juncture, diesel oil at a high pressure is injected inside the hot compressed air in an atomised form. Due to the special shape of the combustion chamber, the mixing of fuel and air takes place very rapidly and the mixture is ignited due to the high compression temperature, without any help of a spark plug. So, the diesel engine is also called compression ignition engine. Due to combustion, very high pressure is produced. 3. Working or Power Stroke During this stroke, both valves are kept closed. The piston is pushed down from TDC to BDC. The force above the piston is transmitted to the crank shaft through the connecting rod and crank mechanism. Excess energy due to the combustion is stored in the flywheel which helps the operation of three idle strokes. 4. Exhaust Stroke During this stroke, the exhaust valve is kept opened and the inlet valve is kept closed. The piston moves up from BDC to TDC. The waste gases are sent through the exhaust valve and the cycle is repeated. During these four strokes, the crank shaft will make two revolutions. The thermal efficiency of a 4-stroke engine is higher compared to a 2-stroke cycle engine. Most of the cars operate on a 4-stroke cycle.",

These ports are opened and closed by the movement of the piston itself. The exhaust port as shown in . Bdc (Petrol + Air) mixture Tdc Spark plug Upward movement of the piston First, suction completed. Then, exhaust completed. Finally, compression for 110°, till TDC. Downward movement of the piston First, we get power for 110° of crank rotation. Then, exhaust begins. Later suction starts through TP. Spark plug (Petrol + Air) mixture Transfer Port (TP) Tdc Exhaust Port (EP) Inlet Port (IP) Bdc (a) .9 . Then, exhaust begins. Later, suction starts through TP. First, suction completed. Then, exhaust completed. Finally, compression for 110°, till TDC. Fuel injector Air Transfer Port (TP) Tdc Exhaust Port (EP) Inlet Port (IP) Bdc (b) Let us study the condition when the piston is at TDC. In this position, only the inlet port is kept opened and the other two ports are closed. The mixture of air and petrol is drawn into the crank case due to the vacuum produced by the previous upward movement of the piston. Also, the mixture of air and petrol above the piston is compressed. The compression ratio for a petrol engine varies from 7-10. When the spark occurs, the combustion starts and the piston is pushed down due to the pressure created. During its downward motion, the inlet port also is closed due to which the mixture will get compressed inside the crank case. At about 70° from BDC the exhaust port is opened (Note: the beginning of exhaust) and the gases are sent to the atmosphere. At about 60° from BDC, the transfer port is opened (Note: the beginning of ‘transfer of charge’ into the cylinder) and due to which the mixture from the crank case enters the cylinder. Refer to the port timing diagram in . Also, the deflected mixture helps in pushing the exhaust gases out, thus scavenging is improved. Thus, during the downward motion of the piston, we get the operation of power, exhaust and suction or intake. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 11.10 When the piston is pushed up by the flywheel, the following sequence of operations take place: 1. Closing of transfer port 2. Closing of exhaust port 3. Opening of inlet port After closing of the exhaust port, the mixture of air and petrol gets compressed and the cycle is repeated. 11.8 Working Of A Two-Stroke Diesel Engine  It is very similar to the operation of a 2-stroke petrol engine (refer to the earlier sketches). In a 2-stroke diesel engine, the cylinder is provided with the inlet port, the transfer port and the exhaust port. The ports are opened and closed by the movement of the piston itself. The exhaust port is slightly above the transfer port. Let us study the condition when the piston is at TDC. In this position, only the inlet port is kept open and other two ports are closed. The air from the atmosphere is drawn into the crank case due to the vacuum produced by the upward movement of the piston. The air above the piston is compressed to a high temperature. The compression ratio for a diesel engine varies from 15 – 20. Diesel oil at a high pressure is injected in an atomised form into the hot compressed air. Combustion starts and the piston is pushed down due to the pressure created. During this downward motion, the inlet port also is closed due to which the air will get compressed inside the crank case. At about 70° from BDC the exhaust port is opened and the gases are sent to the atmosphere. At about 60° from BDC, the transfer port is opened due to which the air from the crank case enters the cylinder. Because of the special shape of the piston crown, the air is deflected and is prevented from going out directly through the exhaust port. Also, the deflected air helps in pushing the exhaust gases out. Thus, during the downward motion of the piston, the operation power, exhaust and suction is obtained. When the piston is pushed up by the flywheel, the following sequence of operations take place. 1. Closing of transfer port 2. Closing of exhaust port 3. Opening of inlet port After closing of the exhaust port, the air gets compressed and the cycle is repeated.

As the fuel has to pass through a fine hole in the carburetter, the petrol should be first filtered.

    "text": "This can be considered as the heart of a petrol engine. Extensive development work has been carried out throughout the world in improving the working of the carburetter. Functions of the Carburetter 1. To evaporate the liquid petrol and mix with the correct amount of air and supply the petrol–air mixture in the desired ratio at all speeds and loads. For normal speed, Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 11.12 the desirable air – fuel ratio is in the range of 17 – 18. At higher speeds, we need a richer mixture and for starting, we need extra rich mixture with air – fuel ratio in the range of 10 – 12. 2. Provision to vary the speed of the engine by regulating the amount of fuel – air mixture entering the cylinder (throttle). 3. Provision for easy starting (choke). 4. In modern carburetters, provision has been made for altitude correction, climatic correction, quick acceleration, etc., by providing multijets and various other means. Dealing with modern carburetters is beyond the scope of this textbook. Only the working of a single-jet carburetter is dealt with, giving the basic principle of working. Working of a Simple or Single–Jet Carburetter A simple carburetter consists of the following parts: 1. A float chamber 2. A venturi tube 3. Single petrol jet 4. Choke 5. Throttle Air from atmosphere Choke Venturi Petrol level Petrol Metallic float Float chamber Venturi tube Throttle Mixture of air and petrol to cylinder Petrol jet . 11.5, maintains a constant level of petrol. The tip of the petrol jet is slightly above the level of petrol and it is located in the reduced area of the venturi tube. IC Engine 11.13 During the suction stroke of the engine, vacuum is produced in the cylinder due to which air rushes through the venturi tube. When the air passes through the centre of the venturi tube, the velocity of air increases and the pressure decreases due to the reduction in area. Due to the vacuum produced, the petrol is automatically sucked through the petrol jet. It is sprayed through the fine hole at the end of the jet. The vapourised petrol mixes with air and the mixture goes to the engine cylinder through the throttle. The speed of the engine can be changed by controlling the amount of mixture, by means of the throttle, connected to the accelerator. For starting, an extra rich mixture is required and this can be obtained by partly closing the choke, thereby reducing the amount of air. Defects of a Single-Jet Carburetter 1. It tends to supply richer mixture at high speed and weaker mixture at slow speed. 2. Starting is comparatively difficult. 3. There is no correction for altitude. 4. There is no correction for climatic variation. 11.11 Battery Or Coil-Ignition System Figure 11.6(a) shows the coil-ignition circuit for a four-cylinder petrol engine. The battery provides 12 V supply to the primary circuit. It is kept charged by a dynamo driven by the engine. The ignition switch is in the form of a key, operated by the driver. Contact breaker Cam Condenser Primary coil Induction Distributor Battery Ignition switch Secondary coil Spark plugs (earthed) .14 The induction coil consists of two coils, one primary and the other secondary. The primary coil consists of 200–300 turns of thick enamelled copper wire and the secondary coil consists of 15000–20000 turns of thin enamelled copper wire. The contact breaker is a mechanical device for breaking and making the primary circuit. It is operated by a cam, as shown in the sketch. An electrical condenser is provided to avoid sparking at contact- breaker points. When the contact breaker is closed, the current flowing in the primary circuit produces a magnetic field in the induction coil. When this magnetic field is made to collapse suddenly by the contact breaker, a high voltage is induced in the secondary coil. The high voltage is supplied to the correct spark plugs at the correct time by means of the distributor and produces the spark.",

It consists of a central electrode surrounded by an insulator. When a high voltage is applied to the central electrode, a spark is produced in the spark gap when the high voltage tries to jump across the gap. The spark gap varies from 0.6–1 mm.

This is similar to the coil- ignition system, except that the battery is replaced by a magneto. The magneto consists of a rotating magnet and a fixed armature. It is like an electric generator. The armature consists of primary and secondary windings. The magneto is located on the outer rim of the flywheel and revolves around the stationary coil.

Overheating may even cause seizure of the piston. Properties of the lubricating oil will change at high temperature and it may decompose resulting in carbon deposit in the cylinder and piston. So cooling becomes essential in IC engines. At the same time, overcooling should be avoided. At full load, about 30% of the heat liberated by the fuel is lost in cooling. Two types of cooling are usually adopted. 1. Air Cooling This system is adopted for motorcycles, scooters, aero engines and also in some cars. Cooling fins are provided in the cylinder and cylinder head as shown in . In large-sized engines, arrangement is made to circulate the air around the cooling fins. The amount of heat dissipated depends on the area of cooling fins, the amount of air circulated, the velocity of air and the temperature difference with the surroundings. 2. Water Cooling This system is commonly used in cars, buses and lorries. Water passages between the double walls of the cylinder and the cylinder heads are called the water jackets. Water is circulated through jackets by a pump driven by the crank shaft. When the circulating water becomes hot, it is cooled in a radiator as shown in . Water used in the radiator should be free from salt and other impurities. Otherwise, the deposit will block the water tubes. It is desirable to add some anticorrosion solution in the water.

    "text": "As modern carburetters used in petrol engines have certain drawbacks, there is a shift towards petrol injection systems. In petrol injection, timing is by no means critical and the fuel may be injected during the suction stroke in the inlet mainfold at low pressures. The petrol-injection systems are mainly grouped into the following two groups: 1. Continuous Injection System In this system, fuel is sprayed at a low pressure continuously into the air supply. The air-throttle opening governs the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder. The advantages of this system are listed below: 1. Atomisation of fuel is very efficient. 2. Supplies uniform mixture to all the cylinders. 3. Volumetric efficiency increases due to the cooling of compressed charge by the evaporative effect of the fuel. 4. One injector and one fuel injection pump are enough for this system. 2. Timed Injection System The timed injection system is similar to the system used in high- speed diesel engines. The timed injection system is further grouped into the following two groups. (i) Multiple-Plunger Jerk Pump System A pump having a separate plunger for each cylinder is employed in this system. At a definite time and over a definite period of the induction stroke, the fuel is delivered into each cylinder. The injection pressure usually ranges from 100 bar to 300 bar.

    "text": "Refrigeration is defined as ‘the science of providing and maintaining the temperature below that of the surrounding atmosphere.’ For this to be achieved, heat has to be removed from the source at a lower temperature and rejected to the atmosphere at a higher temperature. It is well known that heat can spontaneously flow from higher temperature to a lower temperature. However, for heat to flow in the reverse direction, the second law of thermodynamics stipulates that external work/energy should be supplied. Normally, the refrigeration systems are classified on the basis of the capacity of the unit. The domestic refrigerators are classified based on the volume (number of litres), while the air conditioning systems are classified by their load (tons of refrigeration). In case of the deep freezers, the systems are identified with volume and lowest temperatures that can be obtained. The systems can also be classified according to the mode of working as refrigerator or heat pump.",

COP = Q/W when Q and W are in the same units. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 12.2 One should not confuse it with the term ‘efficiency’ which is always less than 1. For example, in a heat engine, heat is converted into mechanical or electrical work. During the conversion, some heat energy is lost due to which the efficiency will be obviously less than 1. But, in the case of a refrigerator, the input energy (W) helps only in transfer of heat. Here, COP is always more than 1. Higher the value of COP, performance of the refrigerator can also be treated as higher or better.",

The schematic diagram of this system is shown in . Condenser High pr. side Compressor Evaporator Low pr. side Expansion valve Qout Qin Win  Vapour-compression refrigeration The refrigerant enters the evaporator at a lower pressure and temperature. Here, it absorbs its latent heat of vaporisation from the substances kept around the evaporator, thus cooling them. The chillness thus produced at the evaporator is known as refrigeration effect. The refrigerant usually comes out of the evaporator with its phase changed to dry saturated or slightly superheated state. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 12.4 Now, it enters the compressor which is the heart of the system. The refrigerant vapour is compressed to a higher pressure and temperature as superheated vapour in the compressor. For this activity, power is supplied to the motor connected to the compressor and it constitutes the major running cost of the system. The compressed refrigerant vapour is led into the condenser. Generally, atmospheric air is blown over the condenser using a fan and it carries away the latent heat from the refrigerant vapour. Water cooled condensers are also available. Therefore, the refrigerant vapour is condensed into high pressure liquid. The liquid refrigerant enters the expansion device which can be a long spirally wound capillary tube in small refrigerators. Here, the refrigerant is throttled to low pressure, low temperature wet vapour, thus completing the cycle. Two other expansion devices are automatic expansion valve and thermostatic expansion valve. Almost, all the refrigeration systems shall be provided with an accumulator to store the refrigerant in the event of any shutdown, for maintenance. If a low temperature, in the order of –50°C is needed, cascade refrigeration systems can be used. Cascade refrigeration system comprises of two individual vapour compression refrigeration systems in series. The two refrigeration systems shall have two different refrigerants. In the cascade refrigerator, evaporator of the first unit shall act as a condenser of the second refrigeration system.",

    "text": "The layout of a domestic refrigerator is given in . It belongs to the vapour compression type. The evaporator which is the coldest part is located in the freezer compartment. A separate door is provided for the freezer where we can store ice, ice-cream and perishable items like mutton, chicken, fish etc. Just below the freezer, usually a chiller tray is provided. Further below and behind the main door, there are several compartments with progressive higher temperatures. The bottom-most compartment is for vegetables where a very low temperature is not necessary. The condenser tubes are kept on the back of the refrigerator cabinet. The refrigerant vapour is condensed with the help of surrounding air which rises Refrigerator cabinet Evaporator (Freezer compartment) Capillary tube Vegetable tray W Compressor Condenser tubes (back of the cabinet)  Domestic refrigerator layout Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 12.5 above by natural convection. In the no-frost refrigerator, the evaporator is located outside the freezer compartment. The cold air is made to flow into the freezer compartment by a fan. 12.8.3 Vapour-absorption Refrigeration System  The vapour-absorption refrigeration system is similar to the vapour-compression refrigeration system except for the manner in which the low-pressure vapour coming out of the evaporator is compressed. This system eliminates the compressor, yet produces the compressor effect by the combined effects provided by an absorber, a pump and a generator. The pump consumes comparatively lesser amount of electric power and the generator can be operated by heat energy obtained from the burning of any low-cost fuel or any heat source including solar energy. The schematic diagram of a simple vapour absorption system is shown in . The refrigerant used is ammonia and the absorber is water. Ammonia vapour coming out from the evaporator at low pressure is absorbed by water available in the absorber tank resulting in a strong ammonia solution. The pump pumps the solution, thereby increasing its pressure and sends the high-pressure solution into the generator. In the generator, the solution is healed by external heat supply. Now, high-pressure ammonia gas is generated which enters the condenser. The weak ammonia solution available in the generator contains more amount of water. It goes back to the absorber tank where it absorbs the incoming ammonia vapour and becomes once again a strong solution. The processes taking place in the condenser, expansion device and the evaporator are similar to those discussed under Section 12.8.1. The absorber used in the vapour-absorption refrigeration system should have high affinity for the refrigerant, remain in the liquid phase under the operating conditions and should possess high boiling point, low specific heat and good chemical stability.

Instead of heating the solution in the generator by an electric heater or by supplying the heat by burning any fuel, the solution can be directly heated in a solar collector. It is rather surprising to note that solar heat can be used to produce cooling effect in the refrigerator or to cool a room by a solar air conditioner. The author has made use of a Japanese solar air conditioner in the laboratory at Bahrain University during 1980 – 1984. As the crude oil in the Gulf countries is expected to be exhausted in about 75 years, solar refrigeration/air conditioning system will become popular in the future. Part B - Air Conditioning",

    "text": "Due to the natural phenomenon of body heat disposal by evaporation of moisture from the human body and inflow of moisture from other sources, the humidity inside a room increases. The increased humidity causes difficulty in disposing of body heat. Also, the room temperature rises due to the heat dissipated from the human body and heat gains from light source and any other equipment. When the room temperature is high, it causes human discomfort. It has been found that for human comfort we need a dry-bulb temperature of 20°C and relative humidity of 60 per cent in the room. Any air-conditioning system should primarily be able to achieve the above said conditions inside the room. Under normal living conditions, a person inhales about 0.65 m3 of oxygen and exhales about 0.2 m3 of carbon dioxide in an hour. If the CO2 level in the room increases above two per cent, it will cause human discomfort. Hence, the air conditioner should supply enough quantity of fresh air called ventilation air to meet the oxygen requirements and maintain the CO2 level within limits. Also, the conditioned air should have a velocity in the range of 8 m/min to 14 m/min and be properly distributed inside the room for a feeling of comfort. Further requirements of comfort air conditioning demand that the conditioned air be free from dust, bacteria, odour and toxic gases. Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering 12.8",

The low-pressure vapour refrigerant from the evaporator of the indoor unit is allowed to flow through the compressor to obtain high pressure and high-temperature refrigerant. The high pressure and temperature vapour is then allowed to pass through the condenser.
