Soils are considered \nas three-phase materials composed of rock or mineral particles, water and air. The voids \nof soil, the spaces in between mineral particles, contain water and air. The engineering \nproperties of soils are affected by four main factors: the predominant size of the mineral \nparticles, the type of mineral particles, the grain size distribution, and the relative quantities \nof mineral, water and air present in the soil matrix. Fine particles (fines) are defined as \nparticles less than 0.075 mm in diameter.\n \nAll structures have to finally transfer the load acting on them to soil safely. Soil property \nchanges from place to place. Even in the same place it may not be uniform at different \ndepth and in different seasons. Hence, a civil engineer has to properly investigate soil \nand decide about the safe load that can be spread on the soil. Geotechnical engineering \nincludes measurement of soil parameters and safe bearing capacity. \n1.1.6.2 Foundation Design Foundations built for above-ground structures include \nshallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled dams and \nretaining walls. Apart from finding safe bearing capacity for foundation of buildings, \ngeotechnical engineering involves various studies required for the design of pavements, \ntunnels, earthen dam, canals and earth retaining structures. It involves study of ground \nimprovement techniques also. It also includes construction and design of simple \nfoundations, pile foundations, well foundations, caissons, coffer dams, construction of \nfoundation of dams, construction of tunnels, sub base of road, earthen dams, and earth \nrelated constructions.\n \nSound knowledge of geology and geotechnical engineering is necessary for construction \nof earth related structures. Earthworks include embankments, tunnels, dikes and levees, \nchannels, reservoirs, deposition of hazardous waste and sanitary landfills. \n \nGeotechnical engineering is also related to coastal and ocean engineering. Coastal \nengineering can involve the design and construction of wharves, marinas, and jetties. \nOcean engineering can involve foundation and anchor systems for offshore structures \nsuch as oil platforms."

Waste water and solid waste should be treated and disposed \nso that they do not create health hazard. This branch of civil engineering is known as \nsanitary engineering.\n \nThe five essential requirements for human existence are air, water, food, heat and light. \nContamination of these elements may cause serious health hazard not only to man but \nalso to animal and plant life. The use of water by man, plants and animals is universal. \nWithout it, there can be no life. Every living thing requires water.\n \nMan and animals not only consume water, but they also consume vegetation for their \nfood. Vegetation, in turn, cannot grow without water. Growth of vegetation also depends \nupon bacterial action, while bacteria need water in order to thrive. The bacterial action \ncan convert vegetable matter into productive soil. New plants, which grow in this soil, \ngrow by sucking nutrients through their roots in the form of solution in water. Thus, an \necological chain is maintained. Water maintains an ecological balance, i.e., balance in the \nrelationship between living things and environment in which they live.\n \nThe use of water is increasing rapidly with our growing population. Already there are \nacute shortages of both surface and undergroundwaters in many parts of the country. \nCareless pollution and contamination of the streams, lakes, reservoirs, wells and other \nunderground sources has greatly impaired the quality of available water. This pollution \nresults because of improper disposal of waste water – both domestic as well as industrial. \nOrganized community life requires twin services of water supply and sewage disposal. \n \nGood sanitation cannot be maintained without adequate water supply system. Without \nproper disposal, the wastes of a community can create intolerable nuisance, spread diseases \nand create other health hazards. The planning, designing, financing and operation of \nwater and waste water systems are complex undertakings, and they require a high degree \nof skill and judgement. \n1.1.8.1 Need for Protected Water Supplies It is necessary that the water which is supplied \nto the public must be invariably free from all types of impurities both suspended and/\nor dissolved in it, any kind of bacteria and any other contamination which may cause \nserious harm to the health of the public. It is therefore imperative to plan and build \nsuch a water supply scheme which would provide potable water free from any kind of \ncontamination.\n \nIn general, the water obtained from wells or springs, i.e., groundwater, is free from \nimpurities and it may be supplied to public without adopting any method of purification. \nThis is so because, in the course of its movement through the porous sub-strata, the \nwater is completely relieved of its suspended impurities. However, before supplying to \nthe public this water may have to be disinfected by chlorination (i.e., by adding chlorine \nor chlorine compound to water) or any other methods, in order to remove any harmful \nbacteria responsible for causing diseases."

The most commonly adopted method of purification of water \nis filtration. In the process of filtration, water is allowed to pass through sand beds and \ngravel whereby minute suspended and dissolved particles are removed. It has been \nfound that the process of filtration is greatly accelerated if water is pretreated with certain \nsubstances, which when added to water forms large masses of precipitates or flocs out of \nthe impurities present which in the process settle down and are ultimately removed. This \nprefiltration treatment of water is known as coagulation which involves the use of alum.\n \nThe water having undergone through the process of filtration is still found to contain \nsome harmful disease producing bacteria which are minutely-sized living organisms not \nvisible to naked eye. As such in order to ensure protected supplies of water free from \nany health hazard, it is necessary to kill these bacteria by disinfecting water. The most \ncommonly adopted method of disinfecting is chlorination which is a process of adding \nchlorine or chlorine compound to water. Other methods of disinfecting water viz., \ntreatments through ozone or ultraviolet rays or excess lime are also in use.\n \nThus, it may be seen that a public water supply system should be such that it is able to \nprovide an adequate and reliable supply of water catering to all the public needs and also \nensure that the supplies so made are not only potable but also fully protected against any \ninflection which might pollute water and cause epidemics resulting in human suffering \nand loss.\n1.1.8.2 Objectives of Public Water Supply System The main objectives of any public water \nsupply system are as follows:\nTo supply safe and wholesome water to the consumers\n• \nTo supply water in adequate quantity\n• \nTo make water available within easy reach of the consumers so as to encourage the \n• \ngeneral cleanliness.\n1.1.8.3 Planning of Water Supply Scheme for A Town or City In planning a water supply \nscheme for a town or city the following points need to be considered:\nSources of water\n• \nQuality of water\n• \nPopulation\n• \nRate of consumption\n• \nTopography of area\n• \nFinancial aspects\n• \nTrends of future development\n• \n1.1.8.4 Sources of Water The various sources of water available on the earth can be \nclassified into the following two categories:\n \n1.

The various sources of water included in this category are as follows:\n \n(a) Lakes and Ponds\n \n(b) Streams or rivers\n \n(c) Storage reservoirs\n \n(d) Oceans\n \n(a) Lakes and Ponds A large natural depression or hollow formed in the earth’s surface, \nwhich gets filled with water is called a lake. The surface runoff from the catchment \narea contributing to a lake enters the lake through small natural streams. The \ngroundwater may also enter a lake through springs. \n \n The quantity of water available from a lake depends upon its size, catchment area, \nannual rainfall and geological formations.

The ponds are \nformed by digging of ground and they are filled up with water in rainy season. \nThe quantity of water in a pond is generally very small and often it contains many \nimpurities. As such pond water is generally not suitable for drinking purposes and \nit can be used only for bathing, washing of clothes or for animals.\n \n(b) Streams or Rivers A stream or river is a natural channel which carries surface runoff \nreceived by it from its catchment or drainage basin. It also carries the groundwater \nflow added to it and the runoff resulting from the melted snow. Rivers are the most \nimportant sources of water supply. It is a well-known fact that several big and \nimportant cities of the world are situated on the banks of important rivers. Some of \nthe examples in our country are the cities such as Delhi, Calcutta, Ahmedabad, etc. \nThis is due to the availability of large quantity of the water from rivers for water \nsupply throughout the year.\n \n The rivers may be either perennial or non-perennial. Perennial rivers are those in \nwhich water is available throughout the year. Such rivers are fed by rains during the \nrainy season and by melting of snow during the summer season. On the other hand, \nnon-perennial rivers are those in which water is not available throughout the year. \nGenerally, from perennial rivers, water may be utilized directly for public supplies \nwithout any arrangement for storage of water. However, if during dry weather \nperiods, the flow in the river is considerably reduced, either the arrangement for \nraising the water level in the river or the arrangement for storage of water will \nhave to be made to ensure the supply of water in the required quantity. This may \nbe achieved either by constructing a weir or barrage, or by constructing a dam and \ncreating a storage reservoir. Evidently, non-perennial rivers can be used for water \nsupply only by providing necessary storage arrangements.\n \n Close to the point of origin in the mountains, the river water is fairly pure but \nas the river approaches plains, the quality of its water deteriorates considerably, \nbecause it picks up lot of suspended matter, clay, silt, etc., and becomes muddy \nappearances. Further, the disposal of the untreated or ever treated sewage into \nthe river is liable to contaminate the river water. As such the river water must be \nproperly analyzed and treated before supplying to the public.\n \n(c) Storage reservoirs The flow rate of a river or natural stream may vary considerably \nduring different periods of the year. It may carry little or no water during dry \nweather periods and may carry huge amount of water during rainy season. Thus, if \nwater is drawn directly from a river then during extremely low flows it may not be \npossible to meet the demands of the consumers, while during high flows there may \nbe operational problems. As such it is essential to create a storage reservoir or an \nartificial lake by constructing a dam across the river, which can store excess water \nthat flows in the river during the periods of high flows, for use during the periods \nof low flows or draughts."

As such the water \nfrom a storage reservoir also needs to be properly analyzed and treated before \nsupplying to the public.\n \n The storage reservoirs are the main sources of water supply for big cities. However, \nthe storage reservoirs are created not only for water supply but also for other \npurposes such as irrigation, hydropower generation, navigation, flood control, etc. \nA storage reservoir for supplying water for more than one purpose is termed as \nmultipurpose reservoir.\n \n(d) Oceans Oceans carry huge amount of water which is estimated to be about 94 to \n97 percent of the total quantity of water available on our planet Earth. However, \nthe ocean water being highly saline cannot be used for water supply unless the \nexcessive salt content of the water is removed. The process of removing salt from \nwater is known as desalination and the salt free water so obtained is known as fresh \nwater. As indicated, several methods of desalination have been developed later for \nthe conversion of salt into fresh water. However, because of the tremendous cost \ninvolved, the procurement of fresh water for water supply by desalination of ocean \nwater has not become common. \n2. Sub-Surface or Underground sources of water The underground (or sub surface) sources of \nwater are of the following four forms.\n \n(a) Infiltration galleries\n \n(b) Infiltration wells\n \n(c) Springs\n \n(d) Wells\nFrom each of the first three forms, relatively small quantity of groundwater is obtained \nand hence, these may be considered as the minor forms of underground sources of water. \nOn the other hand, most of the groundwater is extracted from the last form viz., wells, and \nhence it is a major form of underground source of water. \n \n(a) Infiltration galleries. An infiltration gallery is horizontal or nearly horizontal \ntunnel usually rectangular in cross-section having permeable boundaries so that \ngroundwater can infiltrate into the same, and hence it is also sometimes known \nas horizontal well. It is generally provided in highly permeable aquifers with high \nwater table so that adequate head is available for gravity flow of groundwater into \nthe gallery. It is frequently located near a perennial recharge source and hence, it is \nusually placed along the bank or under the bed of river. The usual depth at which \nthe gallery is placed ranges from 3 to 10 m below the ground surface."

The \nwells are closed at top and open at bottom. These wells are constructed of brick \nmasonry with open joints. For the purpose of inspection, manhole is provided in \nthe top cover of the well. The water infiltrates through the bottom of these wells \nand as it has to pass through sand bed it gets purified to some extent.\n \n The various infiltration wells are connected by porous pipes to a collecting sump \nwell known as jack well. The water collected in the infiltration wells flows by \ngravity into the jack well. The water from the jack well is pumped to treatment \nplant and supplied to the consumers.\n \n(c) Springs. A spring is natural outflow of groundwater which appears at the ground \nsurface as a current or stream of flowing water.

The flow from such \na spring is variable with the rise or fall of water table and hence in order to \nmeet with such fluctuations, a deep trench may be constructed near such a \nspring. The deeper is the trench, the greater is the certainty of continuous \nflow because the saturated ground above the elevation of the trench bottom \nwill act as a storage reservoir to compensate for the fluctuations of the water \ntable.\n \n(b) Contact springs of surface springs. These springs are created by a permeable \nwater bearing formation overlying a less permeable or impermeable \nformation that intersects the ground surface. However, in such springs, \nbecause of the relatively small amount of underground storage available \nabove the elevation of the overflow crest, the flow from them is uncertain \nand is likely to cease after a drought. As such, these springs can also be \ndeveloped by the construction of a cutoff trench or a cutoff wall.\n \n(c) Artesian springs. These springs result from release of water under pressure \nfrom confined aquifers either at an outcrop of the aquifer or through an \nopening in the confining bed. The amount of water available in an artesian \nspring may be large if the catchment area is large. The flow may be slightly \nincreased by the removal of obstructions from the mouth of the spring.\n \n(ii) Non-gravity springs include volcanic springs and fissure springs. The volcanic \nsprings are associated with volcanic rocks and the fissure springs result from \nfractures extending to great depths in the earth’s crust these are usually thermal \nsprings. Thermal springs discharge water having a temperature in excess of the \nnormal local groundwater. These are also designated as warm springs and hot \nsprings. Waters of thermal springs are usually highly mineralized and often \ncontain sulphur.\n \n In general springs are capable of supplying small quantity of water and hence \nthese may serve as sources of water supply only for small towns, especially \nnear hills or bases of hills.

Living creatures of the universe are made of five basic \nelements, viz., Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Sky. Obviously, water is one of the main \nresource, without which, it is not possible for us to sustain our lives. A country’s level \nof water use is one of the key measure of its level of economic development. Developing \ncountries like India uses 90 percent of its water for agricultural purpose, just 7 percent for \nindustry and hardly 3 percent for domestic use. \n \nDespite having a great regard for water, we seem to have failed to address this sector \nseriously. Human being could not save and conserve water and it sources, probably because \nof its availability in abundance. But this irresponsible attitude resulted in deterioration \nof water bodies with respect to quantity and quality both. Now, situation has arrived \nwhen even a single drop of water matters. However, “better late than never”, we have \nnot realized the seriousness of this issue and initiated efforts to overcome these problems. \nSystem of collection of rainwater and conserving for future needs has traditionally been \npracticed in India. The Government of Tamil Nadu passed a Government Order (GO) to \nimplement the Rainwater harvesting as compulsory in the state. This scheme was highly \nappreciated by the Government of India in the parliament house. Now-a-days, many \nstates are following this scheme and ultimately they found the benefits.\n \nThe term rainwater harvesting is being frequently used these days; however, the concept \nof water harvesting is not new for India. Water harvesting techniques had been evolved \nand developed centuries ago. Groundwater resource gets naturally recharged through \npercolation. But due to indiscriminate development and rapid urbanization, exposed \nsurface for soil has been reduced drastically with resultant reduction in percolation of \nrainwater, thereby depleting groundwater resource. Rainwater harvesting is the process \nof augmenting the natural filtration of rainwater into the underground formation by \nsome artificial methods. “Conscious collection and storage of rainwater to cater to the \ndemands of water, for drinking, domestic purpose and irrigation is termed as Rainwater \nHarvesting.”\nI. Objectives of Rainwater Harvesting\nTo provide water for domestic purposes\n• \nTo increase water resource\n• \nTo reduce water scarcity\n• \nTo arrest groundwater decline and augment groundwater table\n• \nTo beneficiate water quality in aquifers\n• \nTo conserve surface water runoff during monsoon\n• \nTo reduce soil erosion and run-off losses\n• \nTo inculcate a culture of water conservation\n• \nII.

In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the catchments and the rainwater is collected \nfrom the roof of the house/building. It can either be stored in a tank or diverted to artificial \nrecharge system.

Components of the Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting System\nThe system mainly constitutes of the following sub components: \n(i) Catchment The surface that receives rainfall directly is the catchment of rainwater \nharvesting system. It may be terrace, courtyard, or paved or unpaved open ground. The \nterrace may be flat RCC/stone roof or sloping roof.

At terraces, \nmouth of the each drain should have wire mesh to restrict floating material.\n(iii) First Flush First flush is a device used to flush off the water received in first shower. \nThe first shower of rains needs to be flushed-off to avoid contaminating storable/\nrechargeable water by the probable contaminants of the atmosphere and the catchment \nroof. It will also help in cleaning of silt and other material deposited on roof during dry \nseasons. Provisions of first rain separator should be made at outlet of each drain pipe.\n(iv) Filter There is always some skepticism regarding roof top rainwater harvesting, \nsince doubts are raised that rainwater may contaminate groundwater. There is remote \npossibility of this fear coming true if proper filter mechanism is not adopted. Secondly, \nall care must be taken to see that underground sewer drains are not punctured and no \nleakage is taking place in close vicinity. Filters are used for treatment of water to effectively \nremove turbidity, colour and microorganisms. After first flushing of rainfall, water should \npass through filters. There are different types of filters in practice, but basic function is to \npurify water.\nIV. Methods of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting\n(i) Storage of Direct Use In this method, rainwater collected from the roof of the building \nis diverted to a storage tank. The storage tank has to be designed according to the water \nrequirements, rainfall and catchment availability. Each drain pipe should have mesh filter \nat mouth and first flush device followed by filtration system before connecting to the \nstorage tank. It is advisable that each tank should have excess water overflow system.\n \nExcess water could be diverted to recharge system. Water from storage tank can be \nused for secondary purposes such as washing and gardening, etc. This is the most cost \neffective way of rainwater harvesting. The main advantage of collecting and using the \nrainwater during rainy season is not only to save water from conventional sources, but \nalso to save energy incurred on transportation and distribution of water at the doorstep. \nThis also conserve groundwater, if it is being extracted to meet the demand when rains \nare on. \n(ii) Recharging Groundwater Aquifers Groundwater aquifers can be recharged by various \nkinds of structures to ensure percolation of rainwater in the ground instead of draining \naway from the surface. Commonly used recharging methods are:\n(a) recharging of bore wells Rainwater collected from rooftop of the building is diverted \nthrough drainpipes to settlement or filtration tank. After settlement, filtered water is \ndiverted to bore wells to recharge deep aquifers. Abandoned bore wells can also be used \nfor recharge.\n \nOptimum capacity of settlement tank/filtration tank can be designed on the basis of area \nof catchment, intensity of rainfall and recharge rate. While recharging, entry of floating \nmatter and silt should be restricted because it may clog the recharge structure. First one or"

The \ntop of pit can be covered with perforated covers. Bottom of pit should be filled with filter \nmedia.\n \nThe capacity of the pit can be designed on the basis of catchment area, rainfall intensity \nand recharge rate of soil. Usually, the dimensions of the pit may be of 1 m to 2 m wide \nand 2 to 3 m deep depending on the depth of pervious strata. These pits are suitable for \nrecharging of shallow aquifers and small houses.\n(c) Soak away or recharge shafts Soak away or recharge shafts are provided where upper \nlayer of soil is alluvial or less pervious. These are bored hole of 30 cm diameter up to 10 m \nto 15 m deep, depending on depth of pervious layer. Bore should be lined with slotted/\nperforated PVC/MS pipe to prevent collapse of the vertical sides. At the top of soak away, \nrequired size sump is constructed to retain runoff before the filters through soak away. \nSump should be filled with filter media.\n(d) recharging of dug wells Dug well can be used as recharge structure. Rainwater from \nthe rooftop is diverted to dug wells after passing it through filtration bed. Cleaning and \ndesalting of dug well should be done regularly to enhance the recharge rate. The filtration \nmethod suggested for bore well recharging could be used.\n(e) recharge Trenches Recharge trench is provided where upper impervious layer of soil \nis shallow. It is a trench excavated on the ground and refilled with porous media like \npebbles, boulder or brickbats. It is usually made for harvesting the surface runoff. Bore \nwells can also be provided inside the trench as recharge shafts to enhance percolation. \nThe length of the trench is decided as per the amount of runoff expected. This method is \nsuitable for small houses, playgrounds, parks and roadside drains. The recharge trench \ncan be of size 0.50 to 1.0 m wide and 1.0 to 1.5 m deep.\n(f) percolation Tanks Percolation tanks are artificially created surface water bodies, \nsubmerging a land area with adequate permeability to facilitate sufficient percolation to \nrecharge the groundwater. These can be built in big campuses where land is available and \ntopography is suitable.\n \nSurface run-off and rooftop water can be diverted to this tank. Water accumulating in \nthe tank percolates in the solid to augment the groundwater. The stored water can be used \ndirectly for gardening and raw use. Percolation tanks should be built in gardens, open \nspaces and roadside green belts of urban area.\nV.

The classification \nbased on speed and accessibility is the most generic one. Note that as the accessibility of \nroad increases, the speed reduces. Accordingly, the roads can be classified as follows in \nthe order of increased accessibility and reduced speeds.\nFreeways: Freeways are access controlled divided highways. Most freeways are \n• \nfour lanes, two lanes each direction, but many freeways widen to incorporate more \nlanes as they enter urban areas. Access is controlled through the use of interchanges, \nand the type of interchange depends upon the kind of intersecting roadway.\nExpressways: They are superior type of highways and are designed for high speeds \n• \n(120 km/h is common), high traffic volume and safety. They are generally provided \nwith grade separations at intersections. Parking, loading and unloading of goods \nand pedestrian traffic is not allowed on expressways.\nHighways: They represent the superior type of roads in a country. Highways are of \n• \ntwo types: rural highways and urban highways. Rural highways are those passing \nthrough rural areas (villages) and urban highways are those passing through large \ncities and towns, i.e. urban areas.\nBased on Usage This classification is based on whether the roads can be used during \ndifferent seasons of the year. All-weather roads are those roads which are negotiable during \nall weathers, except at major river crossings where interruption of traffic is permissible up \nto a certain extent. Fair-weather roads are negotiable only during fair weather.\nBased on Carriage Way This classification is based on the type of the carriage way or the \nroad pavement. Paved roads with hard surface are provided with a hard pavement course \n(for example, stones, Water bound macadam (WBM), Bituminous macadam (BM), concrete \nroads). Unpaved roads are not provided with a hard course of at least a WBM layer.

There is no limit \nto the size and shape of the articles that can be produced by casting. The production cost \nis considerably low. Although all metals can be cast, iron is mostly used because of its \nfluidity, small shrinkage and ease with which its properties are controlled.\n \nCasting process involves the pouring of molten metal into a cavity or mould of the \ndesired shape and size, and allowing it to solidify. When it is removed from the mould, \nthe casting is of the same shape but slightly smaller due to the contraction of metals. \nThe process requires moulding sand which can withstand high temperatures. By using a \nreplica of the required cast which is called a pattern, a cavity of the desired shape and size \nis made in the moulding sand. The metal is melted in a furnace and poured in the cavity. \nAfter the solidification is completed, the casting is removed and cleaned.\n1.8 advaNTageS of The caSTINg proceSS\n \n1. The cost involved in the casting process is very low compared to the other \nmanufacturing processes.\n \n2. Very heavy and bulky parts which are difficult to fabricate can be manufactured by \nthe casting process.\n \n3.

It is light in weight, abundantly available, cheap and can be handled easily.\n \nHowever, wood is easily affected by moisture, and it possesses less strength. Hence, it is \nnot suitable for mass production. The most common types of wood used are mahogany, teak \nand pine.\n2. Metals and Alloys Metal patterns are mostly cast from wooden patterns or machined to \ndesired shape. Metal patterns are stronger, accurate and durable. The other advantages are its \nability to withstand rough handling, high resistance to warp, wear and abrasion.\n \nHowever, metal patterns are expensive and not easily repaired. Ferrous metals get rusted. \nMetals are heavier and difficult to handle. Metals cannot be machined easily. Metal patterns \nare used when the number of castings to be manufactured is large.

The \nvarious reasons are the following:\n \n1. All metals shrink in size when there is a change from the liquid to the solid state.\n \n2. Castings require surface finishings.\n \n3. The pattern should be removed from the mould cavity without tearing the mould \ncavity surface.\n \n4. Casting tends to warp or distort during the cooling stage.\n \nTherefore, the patterns are made with certain allowances on size. The various \npatterns allowances include the following:\n \n1. Shrinkage allowance.\n \n2. Finishing allowance or machining allowance.\n \n3. Draft allowance or taper allowance.\n \n4. Distortion allowance or camber allowance.\n \n5. Shaking allowance or rapping allowance.\nFor quality castings, there should be a balance between all these allowances.\n1.

SolidPattern or Single Piece Pattern The simplest form of \npattern made without any joints, partings or loose pieces in its \nconstruction is called a solid or single piece pattern as shown \nin Fig. 1.15(a).

Loose Piece Pattern It is a pattern with loose pieces which \nare necessary to facilitate the withdrawal of the pattern from \nthe mould as in Fig. 1.15(d). Loose pieces are removed \nseparately by turning or moving through the cavity formed \nafter the main pattern has been removed. These loose pieces \nare fastened loosely to the main part by means of wooden \ndowel pins.\n5. Skeleton Pattern Skeleton pattern is used for making a few large castings. The skeleton \npattern has a wooden framework filled with loam sand. This is to save the amount of \npattern materials used. The final shape is given with a strickle.

The process of making this cavity of the desired shape \nand size on a medium is called moulding. The medium may be ordinary moulding sand or \nresin-bonded sand. In case of diecasting, metal moulds are used.\n1.10.1 Moulding Sand\nMoulding sand is the medium in which the cavity is made for the casting. It consists of a \nmixture of basic ingredients such as the refractory sand, grains, binders, water and some \nadditives details of which are dealt in Section 1.10.3.\n1.10.2 properties of Moulding Sand\nThe principal properties of the moulding sand are the following:\nRefractoriness It is the ability of the moulding sand to withstand the high temperature of \nthe molten metal so that it does not cause fusion.\nStrength The moulding sand should have sufficient strength (green strength, dry strength \nand hot strength) to retain the mould shape under green (5 to 8% water content), dry and \nhot conditions respectively.\nFlowability Flowability is the ability of the moulding sand to get compacted to take up \nthe required shape. Flowability increases as clay and water contents increase.\nPorosity or Permeability The moulding sand should be porous enough to allow the gases \npicked up by the molten metal while transferring or gases generated in the mould to escape \nfrom the mould. This capability of the moulding sand is known as permeability.\nStrength or Cohesiveness It is the ability of the moulding sand grains to adhere to each \nother.

Refractory sand grains give the refractoriness, chemical resistivity and \npermeability of the moulding sand.\nBinders Binder provides the necessary bonding strength to the moulding sand and \nit holds the sand together. Clay is most commonly used binder along with the moulding \nsand. Kaolinite or fire clay and bentonite are the most commonly used binders.\nWater Water is added to activate the clay in the moulding sand. The addition of water \ndevelops the necessary plasticity. The amount of water should be kept within certain \nrange as excess water decreases the strength and the formability of the moulding sand. \nNormally, the water content is in the range of 2-8 per cent.\nAdditives In addition to these basic ingredients, any other materials added to get some \nspecific properties in the moulding sand are called additives. These are mixed with the \nmoulding sand during sand preparation. Some common additives and their purposes are \ngiven below:\n \nCoal dust—for protecting the mould surface against the action of molten metal and to \nget a good surface finish.\n \nDextrin—for increasing the toughness and collapsibility.\n \nIron oxide powder—for getting high temperature plasticity, hot strength and anti-metal \npenetration properties for the moulding sand.\n \nMolasses—for higher dry strength and collapsibility.\n1.10.4 preparation of Moulding Sand\nSand preparation means mixing the moulding sand ingredients such as sand, binder, \nwater and other additives. Mixing may be carried out manually or by mechanical means. \nFor the mechanical mixing, the sand muller is used.\n \nA moulding sand muller basically consists of a cylindrical bowl or a pan. Inside the \nbowl, there are two heavy rollers which roll in a circular path about a vertical rotating shaft. \nIn addition to this, there are two plough blades which force the moulding sand towards the \nrollers for homogeneous mixing. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1.16.\n \nFor mechanised casting, high speed sand muller with two or more high speed wheels \nrotating in a horizontal plane are used."

Green Sand Moulding In green sand moulding, the molten metal is poured when the \nmould is in moist condition. Green sand moulding is the most widely used type of sand \nmoulding. The permeability of the green sand mould should be properly controlled for \navoiding casting defects such as blow holes and air inclusions.\n2. Dry Sand Moulding In dry sand moulding, the mould is prepared with the moulding \nsand having high dry strength and is then dried in an oven. Dry sand moulding is used \nfor large castings and for the mould requiring greater strength.\n3. Skin Dried Moulding In skin dried moulding, the moisture from the surface layer of the \nmould side only is dried to a depth of 25 mm or more by using gas torches or heaters.\n4. Loam Sand Moulding In loam sand moulding, loam sand mortar which is a mixture \nof equal amount of sand grains and clay wetted to the consistency of mud is used. The \nloam is constructed of porous bricks joined with loam sand mortar. Skeleton patterns are \nused with loam moulding.\n5.

The sprue hole is the passage through \nwhich the molten metal from the funnel shaped cavity at the top of the mould reaches the \nmould cavity. Then a riser pin is kept at an appropriate place for making the riser. The \nriser is a reservoir of molten metal provided in the mould and it is also used as a vent. \nThese arrangements are shown in Fig. 1.17(c). Then a sufficient amount of moulding sand \nis added and the entire procedure adopted for preparing the drag half of the mould is \nrepeated. Then the sprue pin and the riser pin are carefully withdrawn. A funnel-shaped \ncavity is formed near the top of the sprue hole. This is called the pouring basin.\n \nThe cope is separated from the drag and the loose sands on cope and drag interface \nare removed. Then, the pattern halves are withdrawn carefully by using drawspikes and \nby rapping the pattern. The runners and the gates are cut in the mould cavity carefully \nwithout spoiling the mould cavity using the gate cutters. The loose sands are removed by \nblowing away with bellows.

Preparation of Cupola The preparation of a cupola furnace begins after dropping the \nbottom at the completion of the previous melting. In this step, the remaining materials \n(coke, slag, and metal) in the cupola in the previous melting are removed. Slag, coke and \nthe metal pieces adhering to the side linings are chipped off. Heat resistant linings are \nrepaired with new fire bricks and clay. Then the bottom door is closed and duly supported \nwith the metal prop. A sloping sand bed is prepared with tempered sand over the bottom \ndoor. The slope gives a better metal flow. The sand bed is prepared by uniform ramming \nto avoid any leakage of molten metal.\n2. Starting of Ignition For starting the cupola, soft and dry pieces of woods are spread \nover the sand bed. A coke bed is prepared over the wooden pieces. The wooden pieces \nare ignited either through the tap hole or through some other opening. The height of coke \nbed is maintained in the order of about 75 cm above the tuyers by adding an additional \namount of coke as the initial coke bed burns well. The ignition is started about three hours \nbefore the molten metal is needed for pouring into the moulds.\n3. Charging After the coke bed is properly ignited, the charging is done. The charging of \ncupola is adding alternate layers of lime stone (flux), iron and coke upto the level of the \ncharging floor. The flux is a substance added for slag formation and for easy removal of \nimpurities. It also reduces the oxidation of iron and lowers the melting point of slag. It \nincreases the fluidity of slag. lime stone (CaCO3) is mostly used as flux. Coke is the fuel \ncommonly used in cupola. The metal charge consists of pig iron (30%), new scrap iron \n(30%) and returns (sprue, gates, risers, and defective castings).\n4. Melting After the cupola furnace has been fully charged, the charge is allowed to \nget heated slowly for about 45 minutes without allowing the air blast. This is called the \nsoaking of iron.\n \nAt the end of soaking period, the air blast is opened.

They are caused by the entrapped gases or steam in the casting. Because \nof molten metal, gases are generated and the moisture present in the moulding sand \naccounts for the steam. For avoiding blow holes, proper venting should be provided. \nAlso the presence of gas producing ingredients in moulding sand should be avoided and \nthe permeability of the moulding sand should be high. Due to low moisture content, blow \nholes will be considerably less in dry sand and skin dried moulding, compared to green \nsand moulding. The blow holes occurring on the surface are called open blows.\nPin Holes Pin holes are large number of small holes occurring on the surface of the \ncasting. This is caused by hydrogen or carbon monoxide picked up by the molten metal \nin the furnace or while transferring it for pouring. When the metal gets solidified, the \nsolubility of these gases decreases. Hence, these gases are expelled out of the casting and \nduring this process, these leave a number of small holes.\nSwell A swell is an enlargement of the mould cavity because of the pressure exerted \nby the molten metal. This causes some error in the dimensions of the casting. This can be \navoided by a proper ramming of the moulding sand.\nShrinkage Cavity Shrinkage cavity is a void or depression caused by shrinkage of the \nmetal. This may be avoided by adequate risers and by proper mould design.\nShift A shift is caused when there is mismatch of the sections of a casting usually at \nparting line. This can be avoided by proper alignment of the pattern, moulding boxes, \netc.\nDrops Drop is caused by the falling of some loose moulding sand from the cope surface \nof the mould into the mould cavity. This leads to unwanted projections or cavities in the \ncastings. This can be avoided by proper ramming and by using moulding sand having \nhigh green strength.\nMisruns Misruns are caused by the incomplete filling of the mould cavity by the molten \nmetal. This leads to unfilled cavities in the casting. This defect can be avoided by having \nan increased fluidity of the metal and by avoiding the small thickness of the casting.\nCold Shuts A cold shut is caused by incomplete fusion of the molten metal stream while \nmeeting in the mould cavity. This leads to a discontinuity or a weak spot in the casting."

The various metal joining processes are welding, \nbrazing and soldering.\n \nThese processes differ from each other in the temperature at which the joining is done. \nWelding involves heating the metals over a higher range of temperature up to fusion \nand then allowing it to cool. In case of brazing and soldering, the metals being joined are \nheated below their melting point.\n1.17 WeldINg\nWelding is a metal joining process in which the joining of metals is done by the application \nof heat with or without the application of pressure. During welding, the edges of the metal \npieces are heated over a higher range of temperature, i.e., these are either melted or brought \nto a plastic condition and then allowed to cool. Welding processes may be classified into \nmany types based on the method in which the heat is applied. In arc welding, heat is \napplied by producing an electric arc between two conductors whereas in gas welding heat \nis applied by the combustion of a fuel gas with oxygen.\n1.17.1 Types of Welded Joints\nWelding may be done with or without the preparation of edges of the metal pieces.

An arc is an electric discharge through the ionised gas column between two \nconductors of electricity namely the cathode and the anode. When two conductors are \ntouched and then separated by a small distance, electrons are liberated from the cathode \nand move towards the anode. Also, the positively charged ions move from the anode \ntowards the cathode. The impact of these electrons and positive ions at high velocity onto \nthe conductors liberates heat. The temperature of the arc is about 3870°C.\n \nAn arc useful for generating heat can be obtained between an electrode and the work \npiece, between two electrodes and also between two metal pieces to be welded.\n \nFigure 1.26 shows a schematic arrangement of an arc welding equipment. An alternating \ncurrent or a direct current source can be used for arc welding process. In direct current arc \nwelding, two types are possible.

They are shown in Fig. 1.28 (a)-(c). A neutral flame is \nobtained by supplying equal volumes of oxygen and acetylene.

The melting point of the brazing alloy is lower than that of the base metal. So, the \nbase metal is not melted during brazing.\n \n4. Bonding requires the capillary action in brazing.\n \nBrazing requires a clean surface, proper clearance between metals, good wetting of the \njoint and good fluidity for the brazing alloy in the joint.\n1.21.1 Brazing Metals\nThe most commonly used brazing metals are copper and copper alloys, silver and silver \nalloys and aluminium alloys.\n1.21.2 purpose of fluxes\nFluxes are some chemical compounds which are added into the brazing joints for the \npurpose of:\n \n1. Dissolving oxides present on the surface of base metals.\n \n2. Preventing the formation of oxides during heating.\n \n3. Lowering the surface tension of the molten brazing metal and thus promoting its \nflow into the joint.\n \nMost commonly used brazing flux is borax. However, metallic halide salts such as \nsodium and potassium chlorides are used to braze aluminium.\n1.21.3 Brazing Methods\nA general brazing method involves the following:\n \n1. Cleaning of the joint and setting proper clearance between the metals.\n \n2. Applying flux to the joint.\n \n3. Heating the joint to bring it to the liquidous temperature of the brazing alloy.\n \n4. Applying the brazing metals so that it flows into the joint by capillary action.

Torch Brazing In torch brazing, the source of heat for brazing is a gas flame torch. It \nmay be oxy-hydrogen or other gas flames.\n2.

This is achieved by the measurement of distances, directions and elevations.\n \nIn general, surveying is limited to operations concerned with the representation of \nground features in plan. A branch of surveying which deals with the measurement of the \nrelative heights of the features is known as levelling.\n2.2 IMporTaNce of SUrveyINg\nThe knowledge of surveying is advantageous in many phases of engineering. Every \nengineering project such as water supply and irrigation schemes, rail roads and \ntransmission lines, mines bridges and buildings etc require surveys. Before plans and \nestimates are prepared, boundaries should be determined and the topography of the site \nshould be ascertained. After the plans are made, the structures must be stated out on the \nground. As the work progresses, lines and grades must be given.\n2.3 oBJecTIveS of SUrveyINg\nThe main object of any survey is the preparation of a plan or a map showing all the features \nof the area under consideration. A plan may be defined as a projection of the ground and \nthe features upon it on a horizontal plane. So, a plan is the representation to some scale \nof the area and the objects contained in it. The representation is called a map if the scale \nadopted is small, while it is called a plan if the scale is large. For example, a map of India, \na plan of a building.\n2.4 TypeS of SUrveyINg \n[Nov, dec 2010]\nThe surveying may be primarily divided into two types: plane surveying and geodetic \nsurveying."

As the plane survey extends only over small areas, \nthe line connecting two points on the earth is considered as a straight line and the angle \nbetween any two lines is considered as plane angle.\nSurveys covering an area up to 260 km2 may be treated as plane surveys. Such plane surveys \nare carried out for engineering projects and for geographical, geological, navigational and \nmilitary purposes.\n \nPlane surveys are used for the layout of highways, railways, canals, construction of \nbridges, dams, buildings, etc. The scope and use of plane surveying is wide. In order to \nhave proper, economical and accurate planning of projects plane surveys are basically \nneeded.\n2.4.2 geodetic Surveying \n[Nov, dec 2010]\nThe surface of the earth is not plane but spheroidal. Therefore, the line connecting any two \npoints on the earth’s surface is not a straight line but a curve.\n \nThe surveying in which curvature of the earth is taken into account for all measurements \nis known as geodetic surveying.\n \nThe result obtained from the above surveying will possess a high degree of accuracy \nas it considers the effect of curvature of the earth also. This surveying extends over large \nareas and so any line connecting two points on the earth’s surface is considered as an arc. \nThe angle between any two such arcs is treated as a spherical angle. To undertake this \nmethod of surveying, a through knowledge in spherical trigonometry is required.\n \nGeodetic surveys need sophisticated instruments and accurate methods of observations. \nIn order to eliminate the errors in observations due to atmospheric refraction, angular \nobservations are generally taken only in nights and arc lamps are used as signals on \nsurvey stations.\n \nIn India, geodetic surveys are carried out by the Department of the Survey of India \nunder the direction of the Surveyor General of India.\n2.5 claSSIfIcaTIoN of SUrveyS\nDepending on the use and the purpose of the finished work, surveys are classified under \nthe following heads:\n1. classification Based Upon the Nature of the field\n \n(a) land surveying\n \n(i) Topographical surveys To locate horizontal and vertical points by linear and \nangular measurements.

Working from the whole to the part Whether it is a plane surveyor or a geodetic survey, \nthe main principle adopted is to work from the whole to the part. In the case of surveying \nof extensive areas, such as a town or a big estate, the survey is started by establishing a \nsystem of control points with high precision. The line joining these points will form the \nboundary lines of the area, otherwise, this is the main skeleton of the survey. The above \ncontrol points may be established by triangulation or by running a traverse surrounding \nthe area. The main triangles and traverses are then broken into smaller ones and measured \nusing less laborious methods. The main reason to work from the whole to the part is to \navoid the accumulation of errors and to control any localised errors. If, on the other hand, \nthe survey is carried out from the part to the whole, the errors will be magnified in each \nand every step and will become uncontrollable at the end.

    "clean_text": "Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering\n2.6\nPacing\nMeasurements of distances by pacing are chiefly confined to the preliminary surveys \nand explorations where a surveyor is called upon to make a rough survey as quickly as \npossible. This method consists in of counting the number of paces between the two points \nof a line. A length of pace more nearly to that of ones natural step is preferable.\nPassometer\nIt is an instrument, shaped like a watch and is carried in pocket or attached to one leg. \nThe mechanism of the instrument is operated by motion of the body and it automatically \nregisters the number of paces. Then it can be multiplied by the average length of the pace \nto get the distance.\nPedometer\nIt is similar to the passometer except that it, is adjusted to the length of the pace of the \nperson carrying it. It registers the total distance covered by any number of paces.\nOdometer and Speedometer\nOdometer is an instrument for registering the number of revolutions of a wheel. The \nodometer is fitted to a wheel which is rolled along the line whose length is required. The \nnumber of revolutions registered by the odometer can be multiplied by the circumference \nof the wheel to get the distance.\nChaining \n[May, June 2012]\nChaining is a term which is used to denote measuring distance either with the help of a \nchain or a tape and is the most accurate method of making direct measurements.\n2.7.2 chain \n[May, June 2012, 2013]\nThe chain is generally composed of 100 or 150 links. The links are formed by pieces of \ngalvanised loops and connected together by means of three oval-shaped rings. The oval-\nshaped rings afford flexibility to the chain. In good-quality chains, the joints of links are \nwelded so that change in length will be reduced considerably due to stretching. The ends \nof the chain are provided with brass handles with swivel joints so that the chain can be \nturned round without twisting. The outside of the handle is the zero point or the end of \nthe chain. The length of a link is the distance between the centres of the two consecutive \nmiddle rings. The end links also include the handles.

A network of triangles is preferred here as triangle is the simple plane geometrical \nfigure which can be plotted with the lengths of its sides alone. Chain surveying is the \nsimplest kind of surveying. In this case, there is no need for measuring angles."

To detect its \npresence, one has to find the fore and back bearing of a line and obtain the difference \nbetween them.

For \ninstance, the construction of railways, highways, canals, dams, water supply, sanitary \nlines, etc. is done through the determination of elevations of different points along the \nalignment (alignment involves the fixing of the centre line of railway or highway as the \ncase may be). Greater the accuracy in the observations, the greater will be the saving in \nexpenditure during project execution. A good network of levels provides an excellent idea \nof the existing terrain for the engineer, who can then plan and design his project keeping \nin view the economy and safety.\n2.9.3 Technical Terms used in levelling\nLevel surface The surface which is normal to the direction of gravity at all points is called \na level surface. Every point on the level surface will be equidistant from the centre of the \nearth. For example, the surface of a still lake forms a level surface. \nHorizontal plane The plane tangential to the level surface at any point is known as a \nhorizontal plane. \nVertical plane The plane which contains vertical line at a place is called a vertical plane. \nThe vertical line at any point will be perpendicular to the level surface at that point. \nDatum surface This is an arbitrary surface with reference to which the heights (elevations) \nof points are measured and compared. \nReduced level (RL) Reduced level of a point is its height above or below the datum. \nBack sight (BS) It is the first staff reading taken after setting up the instrument in any \nposition. This will always be a reading on a point of known height.\nFore sight (FS) This is the last staff reading taken on a point before shifting the instrument. \nThis will always be a point whose height has to be determined.\nIntermediate sight (IS) Intermediate sight refers to any staff reading taken on a point of \nunknown elevation after the back sight and before the fore sight. This is necessary if it is \nneeded to take more than two readings from the same position of the instrument.\nChange point (CP) A change point indicates the shifting of the instrument. Both the back \nsight and the fore sight are taken on a change point.\nBenchmark (BM) A benchmark is a fixed point of reference of known elevation. The \nreduced level of the benchmark is used to determine the reduced levels of other points."

In this section, \nthese methods are discussed.\n1. The Height of Collimation or Height of Instrument Method In this method, the height of \ninstrument (HI) is calculated for each setting by adding the back sight (BS) to the elevation \nof BM. The reduced level of the first station or of the intermediate station can be obtained \nby subtracting the foresight at the first station or the intermediate sight at the intermediate \nstation. \n \nFor the second setting HI is calculated by adding the back sight taken on the second \npoint to its reduced level. The reduced level of the last point is obtained by subtracting the \nforesight of the last point from the HI at the last setting. Arithmetic check can be done in \nthe following manner. \nS BS – S FS = Last RL – First RL\n \nThis method is simple, easy and rapid."

In every society, the role of engineers is to develop the technological \napplication to meet practical needs. For example, the application of an electrical system is \nto provide power to a city, a water wheel is to run a mill, an artificial heart is to prolong \nlife, etc. The systems that supply our food, water, fuel, power, transportation network, \ncommunication and other conveniences are the products of engineering skill. Despite the \nessential part engineers play in the above progress and in the well-being of humanity, \ntheir exact role is imperfectly understood.\n \nEngineering is the art of converting knowledge into useful practical applications. An \nengineer is a person, who plays the key role in this process of conversion. Since engineering \nis the profession which serves people, their environment is an important consideration. \nOften, there have been difficulties in distinguishing engineers from scientists. It is difficult \nto determine where the work of the scientist ends and that of the engineer begins.\n \nThe basic distinction between the linked professions of science and engineering lies in \ntheir goals. Scientists aim to invent while engineers strive to use the inventions effectively \nto cater to the needs of mankind. For example, the German physicist Heinrich Hertz \ndiscovered radio waves while Guglielmo Marconi developed wireless telegraphy using \nradio waves, a feat of engineering. And after the scientific principles of nuclear fission \nwere established, the hard work of creating atomic weapons and useful power plants was \naccomplished by electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers.\n3.2 Civil engineering \nCivil engineering is that branch of engineering which aims to provide a comfortable and \nsafe living for the people. Shelter, one of the primary needs of mankind, is provided by civil \nengineers. The efficient planning of water supply and irrigation systems increases the food \nproduction in a country. Shelters, apart from just being shelters, have been constructed by \ncivil engineers to provide a peaceful and comfortable life. The engineering marvels of the \nworld, starting from the pyramids to today’s thin shell structures, are the results of the"

Communication lines like roads, railways, bridges, etc, \nwithout which development is impossible, are fruits of civil engineers’ work.\n3.2.1 scope of Civil engineering \nAny discipline of engineering is a vast field with various specialisations. The major \nspecialisations of civil engineering are listed below: \n \n1. Structural engineering \n \n2. Geotechnical engineering \n \n3. Fluid mechanics, hydraulics and hydraulic machines \n \n4. Transportation engineering \n \n5. Water supply, sanitary and environmental engineering \n \n6. Irrigation engineering \n \n7. Surveying, levelling and remote sensing\n3.2.2 structural engineering \nStructural engineering is the most important specialisation in civil engineering. The \nconstruction of a structure needs efficient planning, design and method of construction to \nserve the purpose fully. Generally there are five major steps in any construction project. \nThese include the following: \n \n1. Positioning and arranging the various parts of the structure into a definite form to \nachieve best utilisation.\n \n2. Finding out the magnitude, direction and nature of various forces acting on the \nstructure.\n \n3. Analysing the structure to know the behaviour of the various parts of the structure \nsubjected to the above forces.\n \n4. Designing the structure such that its stability under the action of various loads is \nensured.\n \n5. Executing the work with selected construction materials and skilled workers.\n3.2.3 geotechnical engineering \nFor the efficient functioning of any structure built on earth, the behaviour of soil must \nbe known. Geotechnical engineering gives the basic idea about the soil. This branch also \ndeals with the following aspects: \n \n1. The properties and behaviour of soil as a material under “soil mechanics”.\n \n2. The various types of foundations for a structure, for a machine, etc. and their \nsuitability. \n \nGeotechnical engineering also deals with the analysis, design and construction of \nfoundation."

For example, \nturbines use potential energy of water to generate power. Pumps are devices which utilise \nmechanical energy to lift water. The efficient working of the above machines depends \nupon the fluid behaviour which is dealt with in this discipline.\n3.2.5 transportation engineering \nThe development of a nation mainly depends on the communication facilities available. A \nnation’s wealth is measured in terms of the road and railway facilities available. There are \nthree modes of transportation viz., land, water and air. This specialisation deals with the \ndesign, construction and execution of the communication routes.\n \nThe different branches of transportation engineering include the following: highway \nengineering deals with the planning and designing of roads, railway engineering deals with \nthe railway tracks, harbour engineering deals with the harbours and airport engineering \ndeals with the airports.\n3.2.6 Water supply, sanitary and environmental engineering \nWithout food man can survive for days but not without water. The responsibility of \nproviding potable (drinking) water to the public and disposing the waste water safely is \nthat of a civil engineer. The sources of water are precipitation and underground water.\n \nWater supply engineering deals with the location, collection of water, its treatment \nmethods, tests for standard limits and efficient supply of water.\n \nUsed water, solid wastes, toxic wastes, etc., cannot be disposed directly since these \naffect the environment. Hence these have to be treated and tested for the standard limits \nand then disposed. Sanitary engineering deals with the collection of used water, their \ntreatment methods and effective disposal which safeguards the whole world. The natural \nand artificial wastes generated and released into the atmosphere have upset the natural \nequilibrium. Anthropogenic or human-induced pollutants have overloaded the system. \n \nThe role of an environmental engineer is to build a bridge between biology and \ntechnology by applying all the techniques to the job of cleaning the debris. Environmental \nengineering deals with the methods of protecting the environment from the deleterious \neffects of human activity which would result in the improvement of environmental quality \nfor the well being of mankind."

Thus, \nirrigation engineering deals with the controlling and harnessing of various resources of \nwater, by constructing dams, reservoirs, canals, head works and distribution channels to \nthe cultivable land.\n3.2.8 surveying, levelling and remote sensing\nBefore starting any important civil engineering project, such as the construction of \nrailways, highways, dams and buildings, it becomes necessary to have a detailed survey \nmap showing accurate boundary of the project area. Surveying is defined as an art of \ncollecting data for mapping the relative positions of points on the surface of the earth. \nLevelling is the process of determining the relative heights of the points on the surface of \nearth in a vertical plane.\n \nThe main purpose of the survey work is to prepare the plan of the object to be surveyed. \nVarious instruments are used to measure and collect the necessary information to draw \nthe plan. Remote sensing uses the technique of obtaining the data about an area by taking \naerial photographs. The intelligent interpretation gives a clear picture of the terrain. \n3.2.9 Functions of a Civil engineer \nCivil engineering incorporates activities such as construction of structures like buildings, \ndams, bridges, roads, railways, hydraulic structures, water supply and sanitary \nengineering. \n \nVarious functions of a civil engineer are listed below.\n1. Investigation The first function of a civil engineer is to collect the necessary data that is \nrequired before planning a project. \n2. Surveying The objectives of surveying is to prepare maps and plans to locate the various \nstructures of a project on the surface of earth.\n3. Planning Depending on the results obtained from investigation and surveying, a civil \nengineer should prepare the necessary drawing for the project with respect to capacity, \nsize and location of its various components. On the basis of this drawing, a preliminary \nestimate should be worked out. \n4. Design After planning, the safe dimension of the components required are worked out. \nWith this dimension a detailed drawing is prepared for various components and also for \nthe whole structure and a detailed estimate is also calculated.\n5. Execution This function deals with the preparation of schedules for construction \nactivities, floating of tenders, finalisation of contracts, supervision of construction work, \npreparation of bills and maintenance."

All \nstructures are constructed of materials known as engineering materials or building mate-\nrials. It is necessary for an engineer to be conversant with the properties of such materials.\n \nThe service conditions of buildings demand a wide range of materials with specific \nproperties. Hence the properties of the materials are to be studied properly to select \nsuitable building materials. In this section and in the subsequent sections, the properties \nand uses of some building materials, such as bricks, stones, cement, concrete and steel are \ndiscussed.\n \nThe common brick is one of the oldest building materials and it is extensively used at \npresent because of its durability, strength, reliability, low cost, etc. Bricks are obtained by \nmoulding clay in rectangular blocks of uniform size, then by drying and burning these \nblocks in brick kilns.\n3.3.2 Qualities of good Bricks \n[nov, dec 2010, 2011, 2014; May, June 2013; \n \napr, May 2015, regulation 2008]\n \n1. Bricks should have perfect edges, well-burnt in kilns, copper coloured, free from \ncracks with proper rectangular shape and of standard size (19 × 9 × 9 cm).\n \n2. Bricks should give a clear ringing sound when struck with each other. \n \n3. Bricks must be homogeneous and free from voids. \n \n4. The percentage absorption of water by weight should not be greater than 20 per \ncent for first-class bricks and 22 per cent for second-class bricks when soaked in \ncold water for 24 hours.\n \n5. Bricks should be sufficiently hard, i.e., no nail impression must be present when \nscratched. The average weight of bricks should be 3–3.5 kg. \n \n6. Bricks should not break when dropped from a height of 1 m. \n \n7. Bricks should have low thermal conductivity and should be soundproof. \n \n8. Bricks should not show deposits of salts when immersed in water and dried. \n \n9. The minimum crushing strength of bricks must be 3.5 N/mm2. \n3.3.3 Classification of Bricks \n[May, June 2009, 2010, 2014; nov, dec 2010, 2014; \n \napr, May 2015, regulation 2008]\nBricks are classified based on the manufacturing process adopted. The classification is \ngiven as follows:"

These comply with all \ngood qualities of bricks and are used for superior and permanent works.\n \n2. Second-class bricks are ground-moulded and burnt in kilns. The surfaces of such \nbricks are rough and are slightly irregular in shape. Such bricks are used with a \ncoat of plaster.\n \n3. Third-class bricks are ground-moulded and are burnt in clamps. These bricks are \nnot hard but rough with irregular and distorted edges. These give a dull sound \nwhen struck with each other. They are used for unimportant and temporary \nstructures and at places where there is less rainfall. \n \n4. Overburnt bricks with irregular shape and dark colour are classified as the fourth \nclass bricks. These are used as aggregates for concrete in foundations, floors, roads, \netc.\n3.3.4 Uses of Bricks \n[nov, dec 2010; May, June 2013; apr, May 2015, regulation 2008]\n \n1. Bricks are mainly used for the construction of walls. \n \n2. Bricks when moulded in the shape of a gutter can be used as drains. \n \n3. Bricks with cavities known as hollow bricks can be used for insulation purposes \nand because of their light weight they are more useful in speedy constructions. \n \n4. Paving bricks prepared from clay containing higher percentage of iron can be used \nfor pavements, since they resist abrasion in a better way. \n \n5. Bricks with holes are used in multi-storeyed framed structures.\n \n6. Fire bricks made of fire clay can be used as a refractory material.\n \n7. Sand-lime bricks are used for ornamental work.\n \n8. Bricks are used in the construction of compound walls, columns, etc. Broken pieces \nof bricks are used as aggregates in concrete. \n \n9. Bricks of superior quality can be used in the facing of a wall. \n \n10. Bricks are used in the construction of chimneys and other special works. \n3.3.5 Constituents of a Brick \n[nov, dec 2011, 2014]\n1. Alumina It is the chief constituent of clay. A good brick should have 20–30 per cent of \nalumina. This imparts plasticity to the earth. \n2. Silica It exists in clay in a free or combined form. A good brick earth should contain \nabout 50–60 per cent of silica. The presence of silica prevents cracking, shrinking and \nwarping of raw bricks. It imparts uniform shape to bricks. The durability depends on \nproper proportion of silica. \n3. Lime Up to 5 per cent of lime is desirable in good brick earth. It prevents shrinkage in \nraw bricks. Sand alone is infusible, but it fuses at kiln temperature due to the presence of \nlime. Bricks may melt and lose their shape due to excess of lime content."

This \nearth is spread into heaps about 60 cm to 120 cm height. All the undesirable matters \nlike stones, vegetable matter etc. are removed. Lumps of clay should be converted \ninto powder form.\n (iii) Weathering The earth is then exposed to atmosphere for softening. The period of \nexposure varies from weeks to full season.\n (iv) Blending The clay is then mixed with suitable ingredients. It is carried out by \ntaking a small portion of clay every time and by turning it up and down in vertical \ndirection.\n \n(v) Tempering This is done to make the whole mass of clay homogenous and plastic. \nRequired water is added to clay and the whole mass is kneaded under the feet of \nmen or cattle.\nWhen bricks are manufactured on a large scale, tempering is usually done in a pug mill. A \npug mill consists of a conical iron tub with cover at its top. A vertical shaft with horizontal \narms is provided at the centre of iron tub. Several cutting blades are attached to this \nhorizontal arm. The clay with water is put inside the mill and the vertical shaft is rotated \nby bullocks or stream, diesel or electric power. Due to the action of the horizontal arms the \nclay is thoroughly mixed and tempered.\n2. Moulding of Bricks\nThe tempered clay is then sent for the next operation of moulding. There are two methods \nof moulding.\n \n(i) Hand moulding \n(ii) Machine moulding\n \n1. Hand Moulding This is done by a mould which is a rectangular box with open at top \nand bottom.

Moulding is started from one end of the ground. \nMould is dipped in water and kept on the ground and clay is pressed by hand \nnicely so that all is again dipped in water and it is placed just near the previous \nbrick to prepare another brick. Process is repeated till the ground is covered \nwith bricks. A mark of depth about 10 mm to 20 mm is placed on raw brick by \na pallet during moulding. This mark is called as frog. After the bricks become \nsufficiently dry, they are sent for the next process of drying.\n \n(b) Table moulding This should be done by an experienced supervisor. The moulder \nstands near a table of size about 2 m × 1m. Clay, mould water pots, stock board, \nstrikes and pallet boards are placed on this table. Bricks are moulded on the \ntable and sent for the next process of drying.\n \n2. Machine moulding When bricks are manufactured in huge quantity at the same spot \nthen moulding is done by machines. These machines contain a rectangular opening \nof size equal to the length and width of the brick. The Tampered clay is placed in \nthe machine and as it comes out through the opening under pressure it is cut into \nstrips by wire fixed in frames. Arrangement is made in such a way that strips of \nthickness equal to that of the brick are obtained.\n \n The machine moulded bricks have sharp edges and corners, smooth external \nsurface and uniform texture.\n3. Drying of Bricks\nAfter the bricks are moulded they are dried. This is done on specially prepared drying \nyards. Bricks are stacked in the yard with 8 to 10 bricks in each row. Bricks are dried for a \nperiod of 5 to 12 days.\n \nDuring drying it must be protected from wind, rain and direct sun. Sometimes, bricks, \nare dried artificially by hot gases from kiln. But there is change of warping of bricks in case \nof artificial drying. After drying, the bricks are sent for the next operation of burning.\n4. Burning of Bricks\nBurning imparts hardness and strength to bricks and makes them dense and durable. It \nmust be done carefully and properly because underburnt bricks remain soft and hence \ncannot carry loads and overburnt bricks become brittle and hence, break easily. Burning \nof bricks is done either in clamp or in kilns.\n3.4 stOnes \n[May, June 2011]\nBuilding stones are obtained from rocks. It is essential to have some knowledge about \nrocks in order to study the properties of stones. Rocks are mainly classified into igneous \nrocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling \nof the molten material from beneath the earth’s surface. Stones from these rocks are said to \nbe harder. Granite which is widely used in building constructions is a good example."

Deposits are in layers and when load is applied along the layers these rocks easily \nsplit. \n \nMetamorphic rocks are formed by the change in character of the pre-existing rocks. \nThese will be hard if the basic rock is an igneous rock. \n3.4.1 Qualities of good stone \n[nov, dec 2009, 2011; May, June 2011, 2013; \n \napr, May 2015]\n \n1. The crushing strength of stone should be greater than 100 N/mm2. All igneous \nrocks have a strength around 100 N/mm2 and some of the metamorphic rocks also \nsatisfy this requirement. Sedimentary rocks have a lower strength.\n \n2. Stones must be decent in appearance and be of uniform colour. Light coloured \nstones resist weathering action in a better way and hence preferred. \n \n3. Stones must be durable. For the stones to be durable, their natural bed must be \nperpendicular to the direction of pressure.\n \n4. Stones should be such that these can be easily carved and dressed. This property is \nopposed to strength and hardness but this depends upon the situation in which the \nstone is used. \n \n5. For a good building stone its fracture should be sharp and clear. \n \n6. If the stone is to be used in road work, it should be hard enough to resist wear and \ntear. \n \n7. A good building stone must have a wear less than 3 per cent. If it is equal to 3 per \ncent, it is just tolerable while if it is more than 3 per cent it is not satisfactory. \n \n8. Stones must be fire resistant, i.e., these must retain their shape when a fire occurs. \nLimestone resists fire up to about 800°C. Sandstones can resist fire in a better way. \nArgillaceous stones are poor in strength, but resist fire to some extent. \n \n9. A good stone should not contain quarry sap which is nothing but moisture present \nin the stones.\n \n10. A good building stone must have a specific gravity greater than 2.7. \n \n11. A good stone must have a compact, fine, crystalline structure, strong and durable.\n \n12. A good stone should not absorb water more than 0.6 per cent by weight. It must be \ncapable of withstanding effects of atmosphere.\n \n13. A good building stone must be acid resistant and free from any soluble matter.\n \nStones with exposed faces are acted upon by various atmospheric agencies such as \nwind, frost, living organisms, alternate wetness and drying, movement of chemicals \nand rain water. Stones can be prevented from the effects of these agencies if preserved \nproperly. Coal tar, linseed oil, paint, paraffin, a solution of alum and soap, and a solution \nof baryta are some of the commonly used preservatives."

It is done at \nsome depth below the top surface of rock where the effects of weathering are not found. \nQuarrying of soft and hard rocks is done by the following methods:\n \n1. Digging, heating or wedging: In soft rocks like limestone and marble, stones are \nobtained by digging, heating or wedging using hand tools, namely, pick-axes, \nhammers, chisels, etc.\n \n2. Blasting: In hard and dense rocks, stones are obtained by blasting using \nexplosives.\n3.4.4 dressing of stones\nStones obtained after quarrying have rough surfaces and are irregular in shape and size. \nDressing is the process of cutting the stones to a regular shape and size and the required \nsurface finish. The purposes of dressing are:\n \n1. To prepare the stones for a suitable size for any handling and transport.\n \n2. To prepare the stones into a regular shape and pleasing appearance, with neat \nhorizontal and vertical mortar joints between the adjacent stones.\n \n3. To make hammer-dressed surface, tooled surface, polished surface, rubbed surface \nor cut-stone surface to suit a particular stone masonry.\n \n4. To secure proper bedding in stone masonry.\n3.4.5 testing of Building stones\nTo determine the suitability of stones for construction work, the following tests are \nconducted:\n \n1. Hardness test Hardness of a stone is tested by a pen knife which will not be able to \nproduce a scratch on a hard stone. Hardness number is determined using Mohr’s \nscale of hardness."

Low-heat Cement This cement hardens slowly but produces less heat than the other \ncements while reacting with water. This can be used in mass concreting works like \nconstruction of dams, etc.\n4. Quick-setting Cement This cement sets very quickly. This is due to the reduction of \ngypsum content in the normal Portland cement.

Portland pozzolana cement \nis produced by grinding Portland cement clinker and pozzolana with gypsum. It produces \nless heat of hydration and offers greater resistance to the attack of aggressive water.\n6. High-alumina Cement This cement generates high heat while reacting with water and \ncauses high early strength development.

Masonry Cement This cement has great plasticity, workability and water retentivity \nas compared with ordinary Portland cement. This is used for masonry constructions in \nmaking mortars and plasters.\n9. Expansive Cement This cement produces an expansion in concrete during curing. As a \nresult of expansion, cracks due to shrinkage of concrete are avoided. So, this can be used \nfor filling the cracks by grouting and also to overcome cracks formation in reinforced \ncement concrete structures.\n10. Hydrophobic Cement This is a water-repellent cement and is of great utility when the \ncement has to be stored for longer duration in wet climatic conditions.

Definition The term mortar is used to indicate a paste prepared by adding required \nquantity of water to a mixture of binding material (cement or lime) and fine aggregate \n(sand). The above two components of mortar, namely, the binding material and fine \naggregate are sometimes referred to as the matrix and adulterant respectively. The matrix \nbinds the particles of the adulterant. The durability, quality and strength of mortar will \nmainly depend on the quantity and quality of the matrix. The combined effect of the two \ncomponents of mortar is that the mass is able to bind the bricks or stones firmly.\n1.1 Grade of Cement\n(a) M33 grade Cement M refers to the mix, 33 refers the compressive strength of 15 × 15 × \n15 cm size concrete cube at the age of 28 days—used for plastering work.\n(b) M43 grade Cement M refers to the mix, 43 refers the compressive strength of 15 × 15 \n× 15 cm size concrete cube at the age of 28 days—used for bricks or stone masonry walls \nconstructions.\n(c) M53 grade Cement M refers to the mix, 53 refers the compressive strength of 15 × 15 × \n15 cm size concrete cube at the age of 28 days—used for concreting works.\n2. Types of Mortars The mortars are classified on the basis of the following: \n \n(a) Bulk density\n \n(b) Type of binding material \n \n(c) Nature of application \n \n(d) Special mortars \n(a) Bulk density According to the bulk density of mortar in dry state, there are the following \ntwo types of mortars. \n(i) Heavy mortars The mortars having bulk density of 15 kN/m3 or more are known as \nheavy mortars and they are prepared from heavy quartzs or other sands.\n(ii) Lightweight mortars The mortars having bulk density less than 15 kN/m3 are known as \nlightweight mortars and they are prepared from light porous sands, pumice and other \nfine aggregates.\n(b) type of binding material The type of binding material used for a mortar is according \nto several factors such as expected working conditions, hardening temperature, moisture \nconditions, etc. According to the type of binding material, the mortars are classified into \nthe following five categories. \n(i) Lime mortar In this type of mortar, lime is used as binding material. The lime may be fat \nlime or hydraulic lime. The fat lime shrinks to a great extent and hence, it requires sand to \nthe extent of about 2 to 3 times its own volume. The lime should be slaked before use. This \nmortar is unsuitable for water-logged areas or in damp situations.\n \nThe lime mortar has a high plasticity and it can be placed easily. It possesses good \ncohesiveness with other surfaces and shrinks very little. It is sufficiently durable, but it \nhardens slowly. It is generally used for lightly loaded above-ground parts of buildings.\n(ii) Surkhi mortar This type of mortar is prepared by using only surkhi instead of sand or \nby replacing half of sand in case of fat lime mortar. The powder of surkhi should be fine"

But it cannot be used for plastering or pointing since surkhi is likely to \ndisintegrate after some time.\n(iii) Cement mortar In this type of mortar, cement is used as binding material. Depending \nupon the strength required and importance of work, the proportion of cement to sand by \nvolume varies from 1:2 to 1:6 or more. It should be noted that surkhi and cinder are not \nchemically inert substances and hence, they cannot be used as adulterants with matrix as \ncement. Thus, only sand can be used to form cement mortar. The proportion of cement \nwith respect to sand should be determined with due regards to the specified durability \nand working conditions. The cement mortar is used where a mortar of high strength and \nwater-resisting properties is required such as underground constructions, water saturated \nsoils, etc. \n(iv) Gauged mortar To improve the quality of lime mortar and to achieve early strength, \ncement is sometimes added to it. This process is known as gauging. It makes lime mortar \neconomical, strong and dense. The usual proportion of cement to lime by volume is about \n1:6 to 1:8. It is also known as a composite mortar or lime- cement mortar and it can also be \nformed by the combination of cement and clay. This mortar may be used for bedding and \nfor thick brick walls.\n(v) Gypsum mortar These mortars are prepared from gypsum binding materials such as \nbuilding gypsum and anhydrite binding materials.\n(c) nature of application According to the nature of application, the mortars are classified \ninto the following two categories.\n(i) Bricklaying mortars The mortars for bricklaying are intended to be used for brickwork and \nwalls. Depending upon the working conditions and type of construction, the composition \nof masonry mortars with respect to the kind of binding material is decided.\n(ii) Finishing mortars These mortars include common plastering work and mortars for \ndeveloping architectural or ornamental effects. The cement or lime is generally used as \nbinding material for ordinary plastering mortar. For decorative finishing, the mortars \nare composed of suitable materials with due consideration of mobility, water retention, \nresistance to atmospheric actions, etc.\n(d) special mortars Following are the various types of special mortars which are used for \ncertain conditions.\n(i) Fire-resistant mortar This mortar is prepared by adding aluminous cement to the finely \ncrushed powder of fire-bricks. The usual proportion is one part of aluminous cement to \ntwo parts of powder of fire-bricks. This mortar is fire-resistant and is therefore used with \nfire-bricks, for lining furnaces, fire places, ovens, etc.\n(ii) Lightweight mortar This mortar is prepared by adding materials such as saw dust, wood \npowder, etc. to the lime mortar or cement mortar. Other materials which may be added \nare asbestos fibres, jute fibres, coir, etc. This mortar is used for sound-proof and heat-\nproof construction."

It has a high compressive strength and its strength depends on the proportion in \nwhich cement, sand, stones and water are mixed. \n \n2. It is free from corrosion and there is no appreciable effect of atmospheric agents on \nit. \n \n3. It hardens with age and the process of hardening continues for a long time after the \nconcrete has attained sufficient strength.\n \n4. As it is weak in tension, steel reinforcement is placed in it to take up the tensile \nstresses. This is termed as ‘Reinforced Cement Concrete’. \n \n5. It shrinks in the initial stage due to loss of water through forms. The shrinkage of \ncement concrete occurs as it hardens.\n \n6. It has a tendency to be porous.

This concrete is a mixture of water, cement and finely crushed sand with air or \ngas introducing agents.\n \nThere are several ways in which aerated concrete can be manufactured. One important \nway is by the formation of gas or air bubbles using finely powdered metal (usually \naluminium powder). Chemical reaction takes place in the concrete and finally large \nquantity of hydrogen gas is liberated which gives the cellular structure.\n(c) No-fine concrete By omitting sand fraction from the aggregate, no-fine concrete can be \nproduced. This concrete is made up of only single-sized aggregate of size passing of 20 mm \nand retained on 10 mm coarse aggregate, cement and water. The single sized aggregate \nmakes a good no-fine concrete, which in addition gives large voids and hence is light in \nweight. It also offers an architecturally attractive look.\n \nOut of the three main groups of light-weight concrete, the light-weight aggregate \nconcrete and aerated concrete are more often used than the no-fine concrete.\n2. High-density concrete The concrete whose unit weight ranges from about \n3360–3840 kg/m3 and which is about 50 per cent higher than the unit weight of normal \nconcrete is known as high-density concrete.\n \nThe high-density concrete is mainly used in the construction of radioactive shields. \nHigh-density concrete is made by using such a heavy-weight aggregate whose specific \ngravity is more than 3.5. The aggregates used in this type of concrete should be clean, \nstrong, inert and relatively free from deleterious material. Normally barite, magnetite, \nlemonite are used to make high-density concrete. To produce high density and high \nstrength concrete, it is necessary to control the water – cement ratio, correct admixture and \nvibrators for good compaction.\n3. Polymer concrete Air voids and water voids are present in the conventional concrete \ndue to improper compaction, high water-cement ratio and some other causes. Due to \ncompaction, these voids are founed and the strength of the concrete is naturally reduced. \nThere are number of methods available to reduce the air voids but none of these methods \ncould really help to reduce the water voids.

Fibre-reinforced concrete Plain concrete possesses a very low tensile strength, limited \nductility and little resistance to cracking. Due to its poor tensile strength, internal \nmicrocracks are present in concrete which leads to brittle fracture. To improve the tensile \nstrength of concrete one of the method used is that of the conventional reinforced steel \nbars and the other way is by introducing fibres in the concrete and thereby increasing \nthe inherent tensile strength of concrete. In order to reduce the microcracks, addition of \nsmall, closely spaced and uniformly dispersed fibres are used. These fibres act as crack \narrester and substantially improve its static and dynamic properties. This type of concrete \nis known as Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC). Some of the fibres used are steel fibres. \npolypropylene, nylons, asbestos, coir, glass and carbon. The property of concrete may \nvary depending upon the type, diameter, length and volume of fibres.\n \nSteel fibre is one of the most commonly used fibre. Most of the times round fibres are \nused. The diameter of such fibres may vary from 0.25–0.75 mm. The use of steel fibres \nmay improve the flexural, impact and fatigue strength of concrete."

Testing of fresh concrete Fresh concrete or plastic concrete is a freshly mixed material \nwhich can be moulded into any shape. The most important property of fresh concrete is \nits workability.\nWorkability The term workability is used to describe the ease or difficulty with which the \nconcrete is handled, transported and placed between the forms with minimum loss of \nhomogeneity. However, this gives a very loose description of this vital property of concrete \nwhich also depends on the means of compaction available. For instance, the workability \nsuitable for mass concrete is not necessarily sufficient for thin, inaccessible or heavily \nreinforced sections. The compaction is achieved either by ramming or vibrating. The \nworkability, as a physical property of concrete alone irrespective of a particular type of \nconstruction, can be defined as the amount of useful internal work necessary to produce \nfull compaction.\n \nIf the concrete mixture is too wet, the coarse aggregates settle at the bottom of the \nconcrete mass and the resulting concrete has a non-uniform composition. On the other \nhand, if the concrete mixture is too dry, it will be difficult to handle and place it in \nposition. To correlate these two conflicting conditions proportions of various components \nof concrete mixture should be carefully decided. The important facts in connection with \nworkability are as follows:\n \n1. If more water is added to attain the required degree of workmanship, it results into \nconcrete of low strength and poor durability. \n \n2. If the strength of concrete is not to be affected then, the degree of workability can \nbe obtained in following ways: \n \n(i) by slightly changing the proportions of fine and coarse aggregates, in case the \nconcrete mixture is too wet.\n \n(ii) by adding a small quantity of water cement paste in the proportion of original \nmix, in case the concrete mixture is too dry. \n \n3. A concrete mixture for one work may prove to be too stiff or too wet for another \nwork. For instance, stiff concrete mixture will be required in case of vibrated concrete \nwork while wet concrete mixture will be required for thin sections containing \nreinforcing bars.\n \n4. The workability of concrete is affected mainly by water content, water – cement \nratio and aggregate-cement ratio. \n \n5. The workability of concrete is also affected by the grading, shape, texture and \nmaximum size of the coarse aggregates used in the mixture."

The slump test, \nwhich is commonly used in the field, is briefly described below. It should, however, be \nremembered that numerous attempts have been made to correlate workability with some \neasily determinable physical measurement. Although they may provide useful information \nwithin a range of variation in workability but none of these tests is fully satisfactory. At \nthe same time, the slump test does not measure the workability of concrete.

The cone is filled with about one-\nfourth portion and then rammed with a rod which is provided with bullet nose at the \nlower end. The diameter of the rod is 16 mm and its length is 60 mm. The strokes to be \ngiven for ramming vary from 20 to 30. The remaining portion of the cone is filled in with \nsimilar layers and then the top of concrete surface is struck off such that the cone is full \nof concrete. The cone is then gradually raised vertically and removed. The concrete is \nallowed to subside and then the height of concrete is measured.

It is \nthe 28 days compressive strength which is taken as a standard value for concrete of a \nparticular batch. \n \nIt has been observed that the compressive (crushing) strength of concrete is influenced \nby a very large number of factors. The most important of these factors are the following:\n(i) Types of cement The composition, quality and age of the cement used in making \nconcrete influences its strength. Thus, cement that has been stored for considerable time \nmake concrete of lower strength despite all the other factors being the same. Cement with \nhigher proportions of tri-calcium silicates produce concrete that show higher strengths, at \nleast in earlier stages. Similarly, finer the particle size of the cement, higher is the ultimate \ncompressive strength.\n(ii) Nature of aggregates Sand and coarse aggregates are the other two essential components \nof concrete. A good bond between cement and the aggregate is possible only when the \nlatter have sharp edges, clean surfaces and rough texture. Smooth and rounded aggregates \nresult in comparatively poor bonds. Similarly, the aggregates used in concrete making \nshould have in themselves, good compressive strength. For example, if chalk (very soft \nlimestone) is used in making concrete instead of massive limestone, the resulting concrete \nwill be weak in compressive strength because of the poor strength of the aggregate."

    "clean_text": "Civil Engineering and Materials\n3.31\n(iii) Water – cement ratio The compressive strength decreases, in general, with increasing \nwater-cement ratio (other things being the same). Hence, when minimum water just to \nensure complete hydration of the cement is used, the resulting concrete will give maximum \ncompressive strength on proper compaction.\n(iv) Curing conditions Great importance is attached to proper curing of concrete after its \nlaying for obtaining maximum compressive strength. Incomplete curing and intermittent \ndrying of concrete during the curing period may cause a loss in the compressive strength \nto the extent of 40 per cent or even more.\n(v) Weather conditions The same concrete placed in different weather conditions like \nextremely cold, dry and hot, may develop different strength values. The cause is related \nto incomplete hydration of the cement in the concrete.\n(vi) Admixtures Certain admixtures are added to the concrete at the mixing stage for some \nspecific purposes. It has been observed that certain admixtures especially calcium chloride, \nincrease the compressive strength. Some other admixtures (e.g. air entraining agents) \nhowever, affect the compressive strength adversely if proper controls are not maintained \non water-cement ratio.\n(vii) Methods of preparation Improper mixing of the concrete and careless transport and \nstoring may result in poor strength despite best cement and aggregates used in it. It is \nthe workmanship that determines the quality of the concrete work in ultimate analysis. \nA skilled worker can produce best concrete works despite some other deficiencies. An \nincompetent worker, however, may spoil the entire work despite being given the best \ndesigned concrete mix. The voids left in the concrete on compaction and curing have a \nprofound influence on the strength of the concrete.\n2. Tensile strength Plain concrete (without steel reinforcement) is quite weak in tensile \nstrength which may vary from 1/8 to 1/20 of the ultimate compressive strength. It is \nprimarily for this reason that steel bars (reinforcement) are introduced into the concrete at \nthe laying stage so as to get a concrete which is very strong in compression as well as in \ntension. In plain concrete, tensile strength depends to a great extent on the same factors as \nthe compressive strength does.\n \nTensile strength of concrete becomes an important property when it is to be used in \nroad making and runways. It is determined by using indirect methods.\n \nIn one of such methods, it is derived from the flexural strength tests. In these tests, a \nbeam of concrete is cast in standard dimensions depending upon the nominal size of the \naggregate. The beam is properly cured and tested after 28 days. It is simply supported \nfrom below and equally loaded at its one-third span points from both supports till failure. \nThe bending moments, obviously, induce compressive stresses at the top and tensile \nstresses at the bottom of beam. The beam fails in tension. Modulus of rupture or flexural \nstrength is then calculated by using the usual beam formula given below:\n \n \nfc = FL \n____ \nbd 2"

    "clean_text": "Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering\n3.44\n3.8.4 seasoning of timber\nThe process of reducing the moisture from timber is known as seasoning. Freshly felled \ntree contains large amount of moisture. If the percentage of moisture is more than 20 \nper cent then different types of fungus and insects attack the wood. Hence timber needs \nseasoning. Following methods can be used for seasoning the timber. \n1. Natural Seasoning or Air Seasoning In this method, sawn pieces of timber are stacked on \nstone or brick supports, a little above the ground in layers with sufficient space between \nthem under a shed. They are left this way to get free circulation of air for a long period \n(two to four years). This is a slow method of seasoning but it is cheap and simple.\n2. Water Seasoning In this method, the logs of wood are immersed in water, preferably \nin the running water of stream or river for two to four weeks. By doing so, sapwood is \nremoved. The logs are then taken out and kept in open air to dry out. Such logs neither \nwarp nor develop cracks but become brittle and their strength is also reduced.\n3. Boiling In this method, the timber is either boiled in water or exposed to the action of \nwater for about four hours. It is then taken out and slowly dried. Even though the period \nof seasoning is less, it is an expensive method. \n4. Electrical Seasoning In this method, high frequency alternating current is passed \nthrough the timber. The timber gets heated and dries out. This method results in uniform \nseasoning of wood but the capital cost of equipment needed is more. This method is used \nin the manufacture of plywood.\n5. Chemical Seasoning In this method, green timber is soaked in saturated salt solution, \nthen removed and seasoned in the ordinary way. The interior moisture is drawn out by \nthe saturated salt solution and the timber part dries before the outer one.\n6. Kiln Seasoning In this method, the timber is stacked in a chamber or kiln. The chamber \nis artificially heated to 40° to 90°C by passing hot air in it for three to 12 days. The time \nand temperature required for seasoning depends on the type of the timber. This is one of \nthe best artificial methods for seasoning wood. By using this method, moisture content in \nwood can be lowered to a large extent in a shorter period. This method also ensures the \navailability of well seasoned wood throughout the year.\n3.8.5 Properties of Wood \nMost important properties of wood may be discussed under the following general \nheadings.\n1. Colour and Odour Most trees are characterised with a typical colour and odour. A freshly \ncut teakwood has a golden yellow shade. The softwoods like deodar and pine show light \n(white) colours. As regards to odour (smell), quite a few woods are immediately identified \nby their characteristic smell. Teak wood has an aromatic smell.\n2. Specific Gravity Wood is a very light material, its specific gravity being always less than \none (that of water). Woods show good deal of variation in their specific gravity. Some"

    "clean_text": "Civil Engineering and Materials\n3.45\nvarieties may be as light as 0.3 whereas in other varieties of timber, the specific gravity \nmay be up to 0.9. This depends on their structure and presence of pores in them.\n3. Moisture Content All woods are hygroscopic in nature. They gain moisture from \natmosphere. Wood may absorb moisture more than 2–2.5 times than its own weight. A \nmoisture content of 12–15 per cent in air-seasoned woods is considered quite safe for \ntimber being used in any construction. \n4. Grain In a normal wood, the tracheids and vessels (collectively called as fibres) grow \nparallel to the length of the tree trunk. This type of structure is called a straight grain. \nThe fibres may be very tightly and closely packed giving rise to a fibre grained texture in \nwood. In other cases, they may be broad and quite wider (comparatively). Such a structure \nis then termed as coarse grained. Sometimes the fibres do not grow essentially parallel to \nthe trunk. These may grow in a twisted, spiral or interlocked manner. Such structure is \ncalled cross-grained.\n5. Shrinkage and Swelling The newly cut wood loses moisture when made to dry naturally \nor artificially. On drying, the wood undergoes a shrinkage, Similarly, dry wood on getting \nrain soaked or wetted may undergo considerable swelling. Thick-walled cells shrink more \nthan the thin walled cells. It is for this reason that the hardwoods shrink more than the \nsoftwoods.\n6. Strength The most important fact about the strength of timber is that it is not the same \nin all the directions. The strength of wood is determined with reference to the direction \nof grain of the wood under load. Besides grain, many other factors also influence the \nstrength of timber. These are\n(a) density—Higher the density of timber, greater will be its strength.\n(b) Moisture content—Higher the moisture content, lower is the strength of timber.\n(c) Presence of defects—There may be a number of natural and artificial defects in timber \nsuch as cross-grain, knots and shakes, etc. All of them cause a decrease in the strength of \nthe timber.\n3.8.6 Uses of timber\n \n(i) It is used for door and window frames, shutters of doors and windows, roofing \nmaterials, etc. \n \n(ii) It is used for formwork of cement concrete, centering of an arch, scaffolding, etc.\n (iii) It is used for making furniture, agricultural instruments, sports goods, musical \ninstruments, etc. \n (iv) It is used for making railway coach wagons. \n \n(v) It is used for making toys, engraving work, matches, etc.\n (vi) It is used for railway sleepers, packing cases, etc.\n (vii) It is used for temporary bridges and boat construction."

The first and foremost job in \nconstruction is to select a suitable site for the building. A properly selected site of the \nbuilding gives enhanced beauty to the building without any extra expenditure.\n \nThe following points should be considered while selecting the site for any particular \nbuilding:\n \n1. Soil at the building site should not be of artificially made-up type. Buildings \nconstructed over such soils normally undergo differential settlement and cracks \nare quite common in such buildings. \n \n2. The site should not be undulating since this leads to increase in cost for levelling \nthe ground. \n \n3. The site should have its general slope, sloping away from the site in order to enable \neasy drainage of the building.\n \n4. Civic services, such as main water supply mains, electric lines, telephone lines, \ndrainage sewers, should be near the site so that no additional costs are incurred. \n \n5. The groundwater table in the site should not be high. \n \n6. Type of the building also affects the site selection. For example, industrial buildings \nshould be situated outside the city, residential buildings must be near schools \nand hospitals, and public buildings should be located in open areas so that all the \nrequirements may be fulfilled.\n \n7. The selected site should be as far as possible large enough to provide sufficient \nlight and air to the building. \n \n8. The building site should not be in a depression since this will cause drainage \nproblems as well as affect the aesthetic appearance.\n \n9. If the site is sloping, it should be rising towards the back. This improves the \nelevation and also gives the feeling of comfort. On sloping sites, planning with"

The site should be connected with good communication lines such as good system \nof roads and railways.\n \n11. The site should possess good soil at reasonable depths so that the foundation cost \nis reduced.\n \n12. The selected site should be adequate to accommodate all the essential accessories \nrequired in the building.\n \n13. Residential buildings should not be located near workshops and factories since \nsuch locations are subjected to continuous noise.\n \n14. A site along seashore is good from the entertainment point of view but sea breeze \nbeing damp affects health. Metallic fittings are liable to corrode here.\n \n15. The topographical features of the site with natural and artificial surroundings affect \nthe selection of site to great extent. For instance, in a region of the city having large \nbuildings, a small residential building may not be aesthetically appealing.\n \n16. For industrial buildings, the site selected should be such that \n \n(a) all the raw materials required for the industry must be available nearby \n \n(b) the labourers should be available from the nearby areas\n \n(c) the site must have enough space for future expansion, of industry, for the \nconstruction of residential areas for workers, etc.\n \n(d) suitable disposal plant to treat the solid or liquid wastes produced by the \nindustry must be available at reasonable distance\n \n17.

Substructure is otherwise \nknown as the foundation and this forms the base for any structure. Generally, about 30 \nper cent of the total construction cost is spent on the foundation. The soil on which the \nfoundation rests is called the foundation soil.\n4.3 Objectives Of A Foundation\n[Nov, dec 2011, 2012]\nA foundation is provided for the following purposes: \n \n1.

Isolated Footing \n[may, June 2012]\nIn framed structures where several columns are to be constructed, isolated footings can \nbe adopted. The columns involved can be provided with masonry or concrete footing. If \nmasonry footing is provided, steps are given and the foundation area is thus increased so \nthat the stresses developed at the base are within the limit. Concrete can be moulded to \nany shape and hence a concrete footing may be a sloping one to provide sufficient spread. \nIn case of masonry footing, the projection of each step must be 1/2 brick thick and each \nstep is made of 1 or 2 bricks put together. Masonry footing and RCC footing are shown in \nFig. 4.2. Isolated footing is provided under a column to transfer the load safely to the soil \nbed. If the column is loaded lightly, a spread is given under the base of the column. This \nspread is known as footing. For heavily loaded column, the total width of the footing may \nbe very high. This is attained in three or four steps and is called stepped footing. If the total \nwidth of the footing is attained by gradually increasing the width towards the bottom, \nthen it is called sloped footing.\nFig. 4.2 Isolated or Column footing\n2.

The length of a timber pile should not exceed \n20 times its top width to avoid bulking. At the bottom \nof the pile, an iron shoe is provided and at the top a \nsteel plate is fixed.\n4.

Steel and concrete\n \nIn the timber and concrete composite pile, the timber \nportion is used below the lowest level of the ground \nwater table, and the concrete piles, usually cast-in-situ, \nis formed above it.

Steel pile Steel piles are made in three forms: rolled steel H-section piles, box piles and \ntube piles. There can be no restriction on length due to high strength. However, steel piles \nmay be affected by corrosive agents like salt, moisture, acid or oxygen. To prevent the \nsteel pile from corrosion, its thickness may be increased or encased in concrete or chemical \ncoating with paint is applied.\n \nSee Fig. 4.16.

Lateral Pressure on the Superstructure \nThe thrust of a pitched roof or wind action on the superstructure causes the wall to \noverturn. The remedial measure is to provide a foundation of a suitable width. \n5. Horizontal Movement of Earth \nVery soft soil is liable to give way under the action of load. In such cases it is desirable to \nconstruct retaining walls or to drive sheet piles to prevent sliding of earth.\n4.11 FoUNdaTIoNs For maCHINerY \n[may, June 2013]\nThe design of a machine foundation is more complex than that of a foundation which \nsupports only static loads. In machine foundations, the designer must consider the \ndynamic forces caused due to the operation of machine, in addition to static loads. These \ndynamic forces are in turn transmitted to the foundation supporting the machine. The \ndesigner should therefore be well conversant with the method of load transmission from \nthe machine, as well as with the problems concerning the dynamic behaviour of the \nfoundation and the soil underneath the foundation.\n4.11.1 general requirements of machine Foundations\nThe following requirements should be satisfied based on design considerations: \n \n1. The foundation should be able to carry all the imposed loads without causing shear \nor crushing failure.\n \n2. The settlements should be within the permissible limits.\n \n3. The combined centre of gravity of machine and foundation should be in the same \nvertical line as the centre of gravity of the base plane.\n \n4. No resonance should occur. Hence the natural frequency of foundation – soil system \nshould be either too large or too small compared to the operating frequency of the \nmachines. For low speed machines, the natural frequency should be high and vice-\nversa.\n \n5. The amplitudes under service conditions should be within permissible limits. \n \n6. All rotating and reciprocating parts of a machine should be well-balanced so as to \nminimise the unbalanced forces or moments.\n \n7. Wherever possible, the foundation should be planned so as to permit a subsequent \nalteration of natural frequency by changing the base area or the mass of the \nfoundation as necessary.\n \nFrom the practical point of view, the following requirements should be fulfilled:\n \n1. The groundwater table should be as low as possible and groundwater level should \nbe deeper by at least 1/4 the width of foundation below the base plane. This limits \nthe vibration propagation.\n \n2. Machine foundations should be separated from adjacent building components by \nmeans of expansion joints.\n \n3.

The columns of these structures \ncan be founded on soil by means of footings, rafts (or mats) of the beam and slab type or \nflat slab type, piles or piers, with cap, depending upon the load and soil conditions (Fig. \n4.22). When footings are used, strap beams may be provided to connect the columns at \ntheir base and to overcome the effects of differential settlements.

This dual function explains the effectiveness of under-reamed \npiles as potential foundations for transmission line towers.\n \nFollowing are the different foundations for transmission line towers as shown in \nFig. 4.28.\n \n(a) Block foundation \n \n(b) Piled foundation with capping block \n \n(c) Pillar foundations \n \n(d) Augered belled foundation \n \n(e) Footing\n \n(f) Anchored leg \n \n(g) Grillage foundation \n \n(h) Combined footing (elevation) \n \n(i) Beam and slab raft (Plan) \n \n(j) Under-reamed piled foundations \n \n(k) Screw pile foundation \nFig. 4.27 Transmission line tower: Forces on foundation"

A minimum of three guy wires (120° \napart) are needed in all cases. If necessary, guy wires can be taken from more than one \nlocation on the mast. While the mast itself may be supported on a plain circular footing \nor a conical shell rooting (upright or inverted) the guy wires should be terminated at \nsuitable anchors (Fig. 4.29). These anchors may take the form of block footings, piles or \npiers depending upon the capacity required. The anchors are used to resist the vertical \nand horizontal components of the inclined tension in the guy wires. The magnitude of the \nvertical component of the tension can be brought down by keeping the angle of the wire \n(from the horizontal) as low as practicable, but this would be at the expense of extra length \nand increased horizontal force.\nMast\nGuy wires\nAnchor\nCircular raft\nFig. 4.29 Guyed mast\n4.12.6 Foundations for Industrial structures \nIndustrial structures, particularly those found in chemical and processing industries, \npose a number of problems not normally encountered in case of ordinary residential and \ncommercial structures.

These tanks are made of thin steel plates welded together. \nThey are basically of two types, i.e., with floating roof and with fixed roof.\n \nThese storage tanks present special foundation problems, as they are often required \nto be founded on soft coastal and estuarine soils. The tanks are relatively very light \ncompared to the material (fluid) stored in them. Since the bottom plates are sufficiently \nflexible, they are able to transmit their liquid load on to the soil without much structural \ninteraction. Since the bulb of pressure can extend to considerable depths depending upon \nthe diameter of the tank, settlements of the order of a metre are common in the case of \nlarger tanks. Oil companies, however, are wary of adopting pile foundations in such \nsoils, as the cost of the foundation can exceed by several times the cost of the tank itself. \nHence, attempts are normally directed to make the foundation as cheap as possible and \nconsistent with performance. Among the several types of foundations available, those \nwith oiled sand pad, crushed rock or concrete ring wall, interlocking sheet pile ring wall \nand piled foundations with crushed rock pile cap are suitable types for soils in the order \nof their decreasing quality. Some of these types are illustrated in Fig. 4.31.

Dressing of stones is the art of \ncutting the stones to the shape required for use in the structures. It is done at the quarry \nitself. Quarry dressing has the following advantages in comparison to sit dressing:\n \n• Cheap labour is available at the quarry site.\n \n• Freshly quarried stones contain some moisture called quarry sap. Hence, they are \ncomparatively soft and can be easily dressed.\n \n• It is possible to sort out the stones at the quarry for different works. Irregular and \nrough portions of the stones can be removed then and there in the quarry. Thus, the \nweights of the stones as well as transportation of stones are reduced.\nTools used for dressing of stones\nHammers Mason hammer, scrabbling hammer, mash hammer, waller’s hammer, spalling \nhammer, fare hammer\nChisels Crow chisel, soft stone chisel, draught chisel, plain chisel, splitting chisel, punch \nchisel and point chisel\nAxes\nPunching machine\nTypes of dressing Stones for different types of stone masonry are dressed as follows: \n1. Hammer Dressing\nFor rubble masonry, stones are roughly dressed with hammers. The surface thus obtained \nis called hammer-dressed. The stones are made roughly square or rectangular or polygonal \nusing a waller’s hammer. The exposed face of the stone may be roughly shaped by using a \nmash hammer. The lower and upper surfaces of the stones are almost dressed flat.\n2. Chisel Dressing\nFor good Ashlar masonry, the faces of stones are finely dressed by means of chisels. A \ndraught chisel is sunk round the margin of the stone. Its front face is dressed to rock face. \nSometimes, to make the entire face truly smooth, chisel draughts are sunk diagonally on \nthe stone face and the intermediate portions are brought down to a level with the help \nof dressing tools. At length, the chisel marks are removed by rubbing the surface with a \nstone slab and fine sand.\n3. Axed Finish\nAxed Finish is employed in hard stones like granites. An axe is used for the dressing \noperation.\n4. Polished Finish\nGranite, marble and trap take a good polish. This is achieved manually or by the aid of \npolishing machines."

These stones have rounded natural face or \nangular faces or angular broken pieces.\n \nRubble masonry is further classified into three types. They are explained below.\n \n(i) Random Rubble Masonry Random rubble masonry uses stones of irregular shapes. \nThe stones are arranged in a random fashion. The joints are pointes to achieve a \ngood appearance. The efficiency of this type depends on the workmanship of the \nstone mason.\n \n Random rubble masonry may be either uncoursed or coursed as explained below.\n \n(a) Uncoursed Random Rubble Masonry See Fig. 5.11(a). It is the cheapest type of stone \nmasonry. Stone blocks are njot dressed, but used in the masonry as obtained \nfrom the quarry. They are of varying sizes and placed in irregular pattern.\n \n The vertical joints are not constructed in plumb. So, no regular courses are \nachieved. Larger stones are used at the bed level \nand in the corners. However, at 30 cm to 60 cm \nheight intervals, the stones may be leveled.\n \n Spaces between larger stones are filled with spalls \n(small stones of irregular sizes) and packed in \nmortar. Bond stones are used at random intervals. \nThe appearance is not very pleasing.\n \n Uses It is used for compound walls, godowns and \nwalls of unimportant structures.\n \n(b) Coursed Random Rubble Masonry See Fig. 5.11(b). In \nCoursed Random Rubble Masonry, stones of 5 to \n20 cm size are used. Stones are hammer dressed.\n \n Stones of equal height are used in every course of the stone masonry. Thus, \nmasonry work is carried out in courses.\n \n The stones are arranged such that the vertical joints of two adjacent courses do \nnot coincide. Through Stones are used at every 2 \nmeter distance in each course to form bond.\n \n Uses: This type of masonry is used for residential \nbuildings, industrial buildings, compound walls, \nwerehouses, etc.\n \n(ii) Squared Rubble Masonry In squared rubble masonry, \nthe stones are roughly squared with straight edges \nand sides with hammer blows.\n \n(a) Un-coursed Square Rubble Masonry See Fig. 5.11(c). \nIn this type, the s tones are of varying sizes of \ndifferent heights, but with straight edges and \nFig. 5.11(a) \nUncoursed random \nrubble masonry\nFig. 5.11(b) Coursed random \nrubble masonry"

This type of masonry also uses \nthe same stones as used for uncoursed squared \nrubble. But, the work is carried out and leveled \nin courses of different heights.\n \n Each course may consist of quoins, jamb and \nbonders.\n (iii) polygonal Rubble Masonry In this type, the stones are \nhammer finished on the face of the wall to an \nirregular polygonal shape. These stones are \nbedded in position to show the face joints, \nrunning irregularly in all the directions.\n2. Ashlar Masonry\nIn Ashlar Masonry, no irregular stones are used. The \nentire construction is done using square or rectangular \ndressed stone blocks of required dimensions. The beds, \nsides and faces of the stones used in this masonry are \nall dressed finely with chisel.\n \nThe height of stones varies from 25 to 30 cm. This \nmasonry is laid in courses with thin end joints. It is the highest grade of masonry and \ncostly. By arranging stones in various \npatterns, different types of appearance \ncan be obtained. The backing of ashlar \nmasonry may be built with stone rubble or \nbrick masonry.\n \n(i) Ashlar Fine Masonry See Fig. 5.12. \nThis type of ashlar masonry is very \ncostly. In this masonry, all the stone \nblocks used should be finely chisel \ndressed on all the beds, sides and \nfaces.\n \n Height of each course is generally \nnot less than 30 cm. Thickness \nof mortar joint should never be \nmore than 3 mm.The face stones \nare laid as headers and stretchers \nFig. 5.11(d) \nCoursed squared rubble \nmasonry\nFig. 5.11(c) \nUn-coursed squared \nrubble masomary\nFig. 5.12 Ashlar fine masonry"

The thickness of mortar joint may be \nup to 10m.\n (iv) Ashlar Chamfered Masonry This is a special form of rock-faced ashlar masonry. In this \nmasonry, a strip provided around the perimeter of the exposed face ic chamfered \nor beveled at an angle of 45° using the chisel to a depth of 25m. Due to this, a \ngroove is formed in between the adjacent blocks of stone.\n \n Around this chambered strip, another strip of 10 mm to 12 mm wide is dressed \nwith the help of chisel. The space inside this strip is kept rock-faced, except the \nlarge projections that are removed by a hammer. \n \n(v) Ashlar Facing Masonry See Fig. 5.13. This masonry may \nbe called as a combination of ashlar masonry and rubble \nmasonry. In this type of masonry, only face work is \nprovided with rough tooled or hammer dressed stones. \nBacking of the wall may be made in rubble masonry or \nbrick masonry or concrete. \n \n The beds and sides except exposed face are dressed \nperfectly fine and square. Thickness of joint does not \nexceed 6 mm. \n \n Uses This type of construction is used for heaving \nengineering works such as retaining walls, sea walls, \netc. \n (vi) Ashlar Block-in-Course Masonry This type of masonry \nis an intermediate approach between the ashlar masonry and rubble masonry. \nIt is constructed of large stone blocks. The faces of each stone block are hammer \ndressed. This masonry has regular courses. It is actually coursed rubble masonry \nof superior variety. The height of the blocks is kept the same in any course, though \nit is not necessary to keep uniform height for all the courses.\nFig. 5.13 Ashlar facing masonry"

This type of \nconstruction has withstood the test time. Its advantages are manifold. It is highly durable, \nstrong, economical, quickness in construction, improved appearance , etc., Different types \nof finishes can be given to concrete.\n5.4.1 Beams\nBeams are horizontal members of a structure, carrying transverse loads. Beams carry \nthe floor slab or the roof slab. They transfer all the loads (the dead load and live loads) \nincluding its self weight to the vertical members of the structures. The vertical members \nmay be columns or walls supporting the beams. Ultimately, the loads from the columns \nor walls are transmitted to the foundation. From the foundation, the loads are safely \ntransmitted to the sub-soil.\n \nThe RCC beam is subjected to bending moments and shear. Due to the vertical external \nload, bending compresses the top fibres of the beams and elongates the bottom fibres. The \nstrength of an RCC beam depends on the composite action of concrete and steel. Since \nconcrete is strong in compression and weak in tension, Reinforcing main steel bars are \nembedded in the tension zone to give the required tensile strength. Concrete takes all the \ncompressive stresses and main steel bars take all the tensile stresses.\n \nIn addition to the main reinforcement, vertical shear bars called stirrups are provided \nto withstand shearing forces.\n \nBeams may be termed simple beams when the end connections do not carry any end \nmoments due to any continuity developed by the connection. A beam is continuous when \nit extends across more than two supports and is called a fixed beam if the ends are rigidly \nattached to other members so that a moment can be carried across the connection. Beams \nmay be classified as follows.\nGirders Main load carrying members into which floor beams or joists frame.\nJoists Members used to carry roofing and floors of buildings.\nLintels Beam members used to carry wall loads over wall openings.\nContd."

Floor Beams\nThese are the secondary members of a floor system in a building and the main members \nin bridge construction into which stringers frame. In most cases for maximising economy, \na rolled steel shape is used so that the bending is about the strong axis. Beams can be of \nsteel, concrete, timber or stone; generally, steel and concrete are used.\n \nIn case of the reinforced concrete beam, due to the vertical external load, bending \ncompresses the top fibres of the beam and elongates the bottom fibres. Concrete being \nweak in tension needs to be strengthened to take up the tension induced in the bottom \nfibres. Hence steel rods are added to concrete at places where tension is induced thereby \nmaking the beam strong in compression as well as in tension. \n \nBeam loading will consist of both dead and live loads. Where the span is small and the \nexternal load is light, the beam weight may be quite small. When heavy beams are used \nfor large spans, their self-weight may be significant. In any case, the designed section \nshould always be checked for adequacy for the applied loads, and the self-weight of the \nbeam.\n2. Types of Beams\nDepending on the support, a beam may be of any one of the following types:\n \n1. Simply supported beam\n \n2. Fixed beam\n \n3. Cantilever beam\n \n4. Continuous beam\n \n5. Overhanging beam\n(i) Simply Supported Beam A beam supported freely at the two ends on walls or \ncolumns is called a simply supported beam. It is important to note that in actual practice, \nno beam rests freely on the supports (walls or columns) without fixing on the supports. \nHence, no beam is practically simply supported. End connections (supports) do not carry \nany end moments due to the non-continuity developed by the connections of beam and \nsupports.\n(ii) Fixed Beam In a fixed beam, both the ends of the beams are rigidly fixed or \nembedded into the supports (walls or columns). Main reinforcement bars and shear bars \n(stirrups) are placed as in the case of simply supported beams.\n \nHere, bending is constrained at the supports. A moment can be carried across the end \nconnections.\n(iii) Cantilever beam When a beam is fixed in a wall or column at one end and the \nother end is free, it is called a cantilever beam. This type of beam has tension zone in the \ntop side and a compression zone in the bottom side."

An I-section may be split and rejoined by \nwelding and used for beams with large spans and light loads. Such a beam is more resistant \nto bending as the modulus of the section is increased.\n \nAn I-section along with a channel section is used when the beam is subjected to lateral \nloads at the compression flange level of the section.\n5.5 Columns\n[May, June 2013]\nA column is a vertical structural member. It transmits the load coming from the slab \n(ceiling/roof) and beam, including its self-weight to the foundation of the building. \nColumns may be subjected to a pure compressive load (axial compression) or a combination \nof compressive load and bending moment. A structural member subjected to an axial \ncompressive load is known as strut.\n \nCompression member in a truss may be known as chord members or web members, \ndepending on their truss location. Columns may also be called by various other names, \nsuch as braces or struts.\n5.5.1 Classification of Columns Based on Dimensions\nFailure depends on the length of the member compared to its cross-sectional dimensions. \nBased on their length, the columns can be classified as long or short.\n \n \nIf\nleff \n___ \na £ 12, it is a short column and\n \n \nIf\nleff \n___ \na > 12, it is designated as a long column\nwhere \n \n \nleff is the effective length of column which depends on the conditions of the \nend support, and\n \n \na is the least lateral dimension of the column or diameter of column in case of \ncircular columns. \n \nA short column is one in which the ultimate load at a given eccentricity is governed \nonly by the strength of materials and the dimensions of the cross-section. A slender or \nlong column is one in which the ultimate load is also influenced by slenderness, which \nproduces additional bending because of transverse deformations. Thus we see, for short \ncolumns, the failure load is characterised by yielding and for long columns by buckling \nor instability. Members with lengths that fall between short and long columns are called \nintermediate columns. These fail by both yielding and buckling."

RCC Columns\nIf the effective length of a compression member is equal to or less than thrice the least \nlateral dimension, the member is made of plain cement concrete. If the effective length of \na compression member is more than thrice the least lateral dimension, the member should \nbe reinforced.\n \nReinforced concrete columns are of square, rectangular or circular cross sections. The \nload carrying capacity of the column depends on the strength of concrete and steel. If the \npercentage of steel used is less in a column, the steel will reach its yield strength prior \nto concrete. The column will not fail since it can take more load at this stage. Due to this \nincrease in load, steel will yield and the concrete will reach its full strength. Hence, the \nstrength of the entire material is utilised. On the other hand, if the percentage of steel used \nis large, then concrete fails first and the failure will be spontaneous. \nUses RCC columns are used in multi-storeyed buildings and heavily loaded structures. \nRCC columns are very widely used now-a-days.\n2. Steel Columns or Stanchions\nSteel columns are also known as stanchions. These are widely used in industrial structures. \nSteel columns are fabricated using rolled steel joists, channels, angles and plates.\n \nA steel column is a vertical compression member. It supports or girders in a building. \nA girder is a main load carrying member into which floor beams or joists are connected. \nJoists are beam members, which are used to carry floors and roofs of buildings of light \nloads supported on long columns.\n \nThe shape of the cross section of the steel section and the sectional area should be \ndesigned carefully to avoid buckling. The important property required for a compression \nmember is a high value of moment of inertia. I-sections, tubular sections and two equal-\nangle steel sections may be used for light loads. Single-angle sections should be avoided \nfor steel columns.\n5.5.3 Built-Up Sections for Steel Columns\nWhen two or three steel sections of rolled sheets and plates are connected to form a \ncolumn, it is known as a built-up column or box column. See Fig. 5.19(a). Built-up sections \nare compression structural members with wide flanges. Hence, these are used for heavy \nloads. The type of built-up section to be used depends on the type of structure and the end \nconnections of the columns. \n \nSteel compression members are pipes of circular, square or rectangular cross-sections \nand sections such as angles, channels, T or I-sections. These may also be built up of rolled \nsheets and plates. The kind of compression member to be used depends on the end \nconnections and type of structure."

Wood Lintel A single piece of timber can be used as a lintel or three pieces bolted \ntogether along the thickness of the wall can be adopted. A bearing of 150 – 200 mm should \nbe provided on the wall and it should be placed on mortar.

A roof must be designed and \nconstructed to meet the requirements of different climates and the covering materials \navailable. A roof should be durable and stable, strong enough to take the loads coming on \nit, be well drained and waterproof.\n5.7.1 Types of Roofs\nThe roofs are classified according to shape, span and structural design principles as \nfollows:\n \n1. Flat roofs \n(a) RCC roof \n(b) Madras terrace roof\n \n2. Sloping or pitched roof \n(a) Single roof \n(b) Double roof \n(c) Trussed roof\n \n3. Curved roofs \n(a) Shell roof \n(b) Dome roof\n5.7.2 Flat Roofs\nFlat roofs are used in buildings of any shape. They are economical too. They are suitable \nfor buildings in plains or in hot regions, where rainfall is moderate and where there is no \nsnowfall.\n \nFlat roofs are two types, namely, RCC roofs and Madras terrace roof.\nRcc Roofs\n[Nov, Dec 2010; May, June 2011]\nAn RCC roof is commonly and most widely used. In this roof, concrete with steel \nreinforcement bars is used to form a flat roof.\n \nAn RCC roof consists of an RCC slab, built monolithically with the supporting columns. \nThe slab is reinforced in both the principal directions. Load is carried by the slab, which is \ndirectly supported by the columns.\n \nThe thickness of the roof slab depends on the span and loading conditions. (An RCC \nbeam may also be provided to support the slab. The thickness of the roof slab, beam and \nreinforcement are designed based on the roof and the loading conditions.) The roof-slab \nthickness may be 80 to 150 mm.\n \nColumns are provided with enlarged heads known as column heads. To support heavy \nloads, the thickness of the slab over the columns may be increased. The thickened part of \nthe slab is called a drop panel.\nDamp Proof Course\nIt prevents entry of moisture (dampness) due to a leaking roof. Weathering course or \nweathering-proof course is provided on the top of an RCC roof to prevent the roof from the \nweathering agencies like sun, rain, wind, and snow. Also, it minimizes the heat radiation \ninto the room below the roof."

Thatch is used in rural areas at a pitch of 45° to \nhave proper drainage.\nHalf-round tiles These are used for cheap buildings. If tiles are laid in two layers, it is \nknown as double tiled roof. An overlap of at least 80 mm should be provided for these \ntiles.

It is found that about 15 tiles are required to cover 1 m2 of roof \narea.\nTrafford asbestos cement tiles These are made up of cement and asbestos. They possess \nless corrugations and are laid with laps of 150 mm at the ends and 100 mm at the sides.\nEternit slates These are fire resistant, light and cool.

Weathering course is a layer \nprovided on the top of RCC or Madras terrace roof to protect the roof from the weathering \nagencies like rain, wind, sun and snow. Weathering course prevents entry of rain water \ninto the roof slab or terrace. It also arrests the penetration of heat into the room below the \nroof.\n \nWeathering course consists of lime concrete with broken brick aggregate and two \ncourses of flat tiles set in cement mortar 1:3 mixed with crude oil.

This technique of weather proofing is \nillustrated in Fig. 5.37. A good fall or slope to the surface from 1 in 20 to 1 in 40, \ndepending upon the intensity of rainfall should be given.\n \n2. An alternative technique of weather proofing the RCC flat roofs is by using plastic \ntransparent films, as shown in Fig. 5.38. These films of alkathene or Polythene are \navailable in thicknesses from 100 to 700 gauge in rolls of 1.8 m width.\n \n3.

Mud and Moorum Flooring\nMud Flooring\nMethod of construction The floor bed should be well prepared and a 250 mm thick layer of \nselected moist earth is evenly spread out and is rammed well so as to get a consolidated \nthickness of 150 mm. No water is used during the process of ramming. In order to prevent \nformation of cracks after drying, chopped straw in small quantity is mixed with the moist \nearth before ramming. Upon this bed, a thin coat of cement, cowdung plaster (1 cement: 4 \ncowdung) is applied evenly and wiped clean by hand.\nMoorum Flooring\nMethod of construction In this type of floor, a hard bed is prepared by laying a 25-cm thick \nlayer of hand packed rubble boulders and then wetted and rammed hard. Upon this \nhard bed, a 15-cm thick layer of moorum (disintegrated rock) with coarse pieces at the \nbottom and finer at the top is laid. Over this layer of moorum another 25-mm thick layer \nof powdered moorum is spread. Water should then be sprinkled on the entire surface and \nrammed well. Finally, over the dry hard surface a thin coat of cement plaster (1 cement: 4 \ncowdung) is applied evenly and wiped cleanly by hand.\nSuitability Mud floors are generally used for unimportant buildings particularly in \nvillages. \nAdvantages They are cheap, hard, fairly impervious and easy in construction and \nmaintenance.\n2. Brick Flooring\nMethod of construction In this flooring the subgrade is compacted properly to the desired \nlevel. 10-15 cm thick layer of lean cement concrete ( 1: 8: 16) or lime concrete is laid over \nthe prepared subgrade. This forms the base course, over which bricks are laid in desired \npattern on 12mm thick mortar bed in such a way that all the joints are filled with mortar.\nSuitability Brick floors are suitable for warehouses, stones and godowns or in places where \nbricks are available economically.\nAdvantages This floor is cheap, non-slippery, durable, sufficiently hard and easily \nrepairable."

Asphalt mastic flooring Asphalt mastic is a mixture of sand (or grit) and asphalt in the \nratio of 2:1. It is mixed hot and then is laid in continuous sheets. It can also be applied cold, \nby mixing with mineral oil and asbestos. The thickness of the asphalt mastic may be 2.5 \ncm for ordinary construction. It is laid on cement concrete base and is spread by means \nof trowel to get a levelled surface. On the top of the surface, a thin layer of sand is spread, \nwhich is then rubbed with a trowel.

Asphalt blocks are first laid on concrete base and then acidproof asphalt \nis uniformly spread over the surface of the blocks. Fine sand is spread over the liquid \nasphalt before it hardens.\n11. Industrial Flooring\nIn most of the industries, cement concrete flooring is commonly adopted since it is \nmoderately cheap, easy to construct and quite durable. The floor consists of the following \ntwo components:\n \n(a) Base concrete\n \n(b) Wearing surface \n \nThe two components of the floor can be constructed either monolithically (i.e. laying \nthe wearing surface immediately after the base concrete is laid) or non-monolithically. \nThe method of laying cement concrete flooring on ground floor of an industry can be \nbroadly divided into the following three steps:\n \n(a) Preparation of sub-base\n \n(b) Laying of the base concrete\n \n(c) Laying the wearing surface\n1. preparation of sub-base The earth filling in plinth is consolidated thoroughly so as to \nensure that no loose pockets are left in the whole area. Then a 10–15 cm thick layer of clean \ncoarse sand is spread over the whole area. The sand layer is consolidated and dressed to \nthe required level and slope. \n2. Laying of base concrete The base course may be 7.5–10 cm thick, either in lean cement \nconcrete (1:3:6 to 1:5:10) or lime concrete containing 40 per cent mortar of 1:2 lime-sand \n(or 1 lime : 1 surkhi : 1 sand) and 60 per cent coarse aggregate of 40 mm nominal size. The \nbase course is laid over well-compacted soil, compacted properly and levelled to rough \nsurface. It should be properly cured.\n3. Laying the wearing surface The wearing surface is laid in square or rectangular panels, \nby using either glass or plain asbestos strips or by using wooden battens set on mortar \nbed. The panels may be 1 × 1 m, 2 × 2 m, 1 × 2 m in size. The wearing surface consists of \n1:2:4 cement concrete, laid to the thickness of 4 cm. Before laying the concrete in the panel, \na coat of neat cement slurry is applied to ensure proper bond of topping with the base \ncourse.\nAdvantages\n \n(a) It possesses good wearing properties.\n \n(b) It is easy to construct and maintain. \n \n(c) It is non-absorbent, smooth and pleasing in appearance.\n \n(d) It is durable and hence it is commonly used in factories and industries.\n \n(e) It is economical."

Granite Flooring\nGranite flooring is a superior type of flooring commonly used in residential buildings, \nshopping complex, hospitals, offices, etc. where extra cleanliness is an essential \nrequirement. Granite stone is available in the form of 8 mm and 12 mm thick tiles and \n20 mm thick slab. These tiles and slabs are available in any shape and size. Before laying \nthe tiles, neat cement slurry is spread over the bedding mortar and the tiles are laid flat \nover it. Then they are pressed gently into the bedding mortar with the help of wooden \nmallet, till a levelled surface is obtained. Also, a thin paste of cement is applied on the \nbottom of the tiles before laying. After a day, the joints between adjacent tiles are cleaned \nof loose mortar, etc. to a depth of 5 mm. This is done by using wire brush and then the \njoints are grouted with cement slurry of the same colour shade as that of the tiles. The \nflooring is then cured for seven days.\n13. Linoleum Flooring\nLinoleum is produced from linseed oil, pigments, gum and wood or cork flour. Linoleum \nis laid on wooden or concrete floors to improve their durability and appearance. It is \navailable in rolls having various colors and designs. Linoleum tiles are also available. It is \nattractive, economical and easy to wash. But it does not offer resistance against dampness \nand fire. Linoleum flooring is used in railway coaches, ships etc.\n5.9 Damp-Proofing\nDamp-proofing is the method adopted to prevent the entry of dampness into a building, so \nas to keep them dry, habitable and safe. The provision of damp-proofing courses prevents \nthe entry of moisture from walls, floors and basement of a building.\n1. Causes of dampness There are various causes which are responsible for the entry of \ndampness in a structure. They are listed below.\n(i) entry of moisture from the ground Building materials used in the foundation may absorb \nmoisture from the pervious soil by capillary action. This will lead to the entry of dampness \nto the floor and walls.\n(ii) entry of rain water The unprotected exposed surfaces and leaking roofs become sources \nof entry of rain water into a structure thereby leading to dampness.\n(iii) exposed tops of walls Dampness may enter through the exposed tops of parapet walls \nand compound walls. This may lead to serious consequences. \n(iv) Deposition of atmospheric moisture on walls, floors and ceilings When warm humid \nair is cooled, condensation of water vapour takes place. This is the main source which"

This is evident mainly in badly designed \nkitchens. \n(v) Location Dampness will enter into the structure which is located on a site that cannot \nbe easily drained.\n(vi) Orientation of walls The walls obtaining less sunshine and heavy showers of rain are \nliable to become damp.\n(vii) Workmanship The dampness is also caused due to bad workmanship in construction \nsuch as defective rainwater pipe connections, defective joints in the roofs, improper \nconnections of walls, etc.\n2. Effects of dampness Following are the effects of dampness in a structure:\n \n1. A damp building creates unhealthy conditions for those who occupy it.\n \n2. Corrosion of the metals used in building construction is evident.\n \n3. Formation of unsightly patches on the wall surfaces and ceilings. \n \n4. Formation of dry-rot leading to the decay of timber in a damp atmosphere. \n \n5. Deterioration of electrical fittings.\n \n6. Floor covering materials are seriously damaged. \n \n7. Acceleration of the growth of termites.\n \n8. Softening and crumbling of the plaster.\n3. Requirement of an ideal material for damp-proofing\n \n1. The damp-proof course should remain effective during the life of the building. \nHence, the material should be durable.\n \n2. It should remain steady and should not allow any movement in itself.\n \n3. It should be impervious.\n \n4. The material should safely resist the load coming on it.\n \n5. It should be strong enough to undergo some structural movement without \nfracture.\n4. Materials used for damp-proofing\n(i) Hot bitumen It is flexible and should be applied with a minimum thickness of 3 mm.\n(ii) Mastic asphalt It is a semi-rigid material and it forms an excellent impervious layer. It \nis very durable but can withstand only slight distortion.\n(iii) Bituminous felts It is also flexible and it is available in rolls of normal width. This can \naccommodate slight movements. It is liable to squeeze out under pressure.\n(iv) Metal sheets of lead, copper and aluminium Metal sheets can also be used as damp-\nproofing material. These metal sheets are flexible and do not squeeze out under pressure. \nThe surface of lead coming in contact with lime and cement will be corroded and hence"

Lime plaster Lime plaster is an intimate mixture of equal proportions of lime and \nsand, ground in a mortar mill to form a paste of required consistency. Sand to be used in \nthe mortar should not pass through a 100 - mesh sieve for more than five per cent or a 50 \nmesh sieve for more than 20 per cent. Water and sand used should be clean and free from \nall deleterious materials.\n \nFat lime or poor lime is used in lime plaster. To improve the strength of lime mortar, \nsmall quantity of cement is added. This mortar is mainly used for external work.\n2. Cement plaster Cement plaster is an intimate mixture of Portland cement and sand \nwith required amount of water to make a plastic mass. The proportion of cement and sand \ndepends upon the nature of work. The ingredients are first mixed in a dry state and water \nis added to make a paste. This plaster should be used within 30 minutes since cement \nstarts setting after 30 minutes.\n3. Mud plaster Mud plaster is prepared with equal volumes of clay or brick earth and \nof chopped straw, hay, loose soil or cowdung and hemp. The ingredients are mixed and \nleft for seven days with large quantity of water. Then, it is again mixed till it reaches the \nrequired consistency before using. Mud plaster made of sand and clay can also be used.\n4. Waterproof plaster This plaster consists of one part of cement, two parts of sand and \npulverised alum at the rate of 12 kg/m3 of sand. In order to make this to be waterproof, \nsoap water containing about 75 gm soap/litre of water is added.\n5.10.3 Requirements of a Good plaster \n \n1. It should provide a smooth, non-absorbent and washable surface.\n \n2. It should not shrink while drying which results in cracking of the surface. \n \n3. It should adhere firmly to the surface and resist the effects of atmospheric \nagencies.\n \n4. It should offer good insulation against sound and high resistance against fire. \n \n5. It should provide to a decorative appearance the surface and should be durable.\n5.10.4 Methods of plastering \nPlaster may be applied in one, two or three coats. In the cheapest construction, one coat of \nplaster is used. In ordinary works, two coats are adopted and in superior jobs, three coats \nare applied.\n1. Plastering in two coats The procedure for carrying out the plastering in cement in two \ncoats is as follows:\n \n1. The mortar joints are raked out to a depth of 20 mm and the surface is cleaned and \nwell watered.\n \n2. If the surface to be plastered is very rough, a preliminary coat is applied."

A solution of 1 part \nof HCl acid or H2SO4 acid and 5 parts of clean water is prepared and applied on \nthe affected area. The surface is then cleaned with water. The surface is kept under \nobservation for few days. If efflorescence appears again, it is removed and painting \ncan be done only when it ceases.\n \n4. Bricks of superior class should be used.\n \n5. The surface to be plastered should be well watered so that it may not absorb water \nfrom the plaster. \n \n6. Excessive trowelling should be avoided.\n \n7. Damp-proof courses should be provided at convenient places in the building. \n \n8. Fresh plastered surfaces should be protected from superfluous quantity of water \nand excessive heat.\n5.11 Valuation\nValue means worth of an asset. Valuation implies the act of estimating the price for an \nasset, based on its present condition.\n \nIn general, all properties are classified broadly into two categories: immovable property \nand movable property.\n \nImmovable property includes land, buildings, mines, trees, quarries, etc. Movable \nproperty includes things which can be moved from place to place, e.g., coal, oil, building \nmaterials such as steel, cement, jelly and sand. Movable properties are otherwise called \nchattels."

There are many factors \ninfluencing the value of a property and they will vary from place to place and type of \nproperty. So valuation needs a thorough understanding regarding the property, as it is a \nmoney matter.\n5.11.1 Objectives of Valuation \nThe purpose of valuation is to arrive at a fair and reasonable price for any existing \nproperty.\n \nThe following are main objectives of valuation of a property:\n1. Buying and selling of the properties Whenever one wants to buy or sell a property, one \nmust be aware of the value prevailing in the market at that time.\n2. Taxation Tax schedule is prepared based on valuation only. Government taxes such \nas estate duty, wealth-tax, capital gain tax and gift tax are calculated based on valuation \nonly.\n3. Security of loans When loans are to be granted against a property, the valuation of the \nproperty has to be carried out.\n4. Rent determination In order to determine the probable amount of rent from a property \nsuch as a house, valuation is essential.\n5. Compulsory acquisition Sometimes a property may be acquired by law and, in that \ncase, the owner of the property has to be paid a suitable compensation. The above is \npossible through valuation.\n6. Speculation Sometimes a person may purchase a property, with a view to develop it \nin future. To gauge the potential of a property, valuation is necessary.\n7. Private development Valuation becomes essential for a property to be purchased by a \nperson with a view to improve it for personal use.\n8. Betterment charges When the property comes under some town-planning scheme of \nthe area, its value will increase and consequently, the owner has to pay additional tax \nknown as betterment charges. So, it becomes necessary for the owner to know the value \nof his property before and after the town-planning scheme execution.\n9. Court fees, registration charges When a case has to be filed with respect to a real \nestate, valuation becomes necessary, to affix the stamp of suitable amount. Similarly for \ntransferring a property, the registration charges are fixed based on the value of property \nonly.\n10. Insurance For the purpose of insuring a property, valuation is necessary.\n11. Reinstatement The process of reinstating a property needs its current value."

    "clean_text": "Superstructure\n5.59\n5.11.2 Valuation of Building\nThe value of a building depends on the type of the building, its structure, the quality of \nmaterials used in the construction, and so on. The value of the building also depends on \nthe place of location, the height of the building, the height of plinth, the thickness of wall, \nthe type of floor, roof, doors and windows, etc. The value also depends on the demand \nwhich varies from time to time.\n \nWhile valuing a building, the age of the building should be obtained from the past \nrecords.\n \nThe following methods are used for the valuation of a building: \n1. Rental method of valuation In this method, net income by way of rent is determined by \ndeducting the outgoings from the gross rent.\nNet income = Gross rent – Outgoings \n \nThen a suitable interest is assumed and year’s purchase is calculated. Now, the value of \nthe building is obtained as the product of net income and year’s purchase. \n2. Direct comparison with capitalised value This method may be adopted if the rental \nvalue of a building is not available but the sale price of a similar property is available. The \nvalue of the concerned property is fixed in comparison with the value of similar property \nin the locality.\n3. Valuation based on profit This method is suitable for public buildings such as hotels, \ncinema theatres, auditoriums and music halls for which the value depends on the profit. \nFor the above cases, the value is obtained by multiplying the net profit with the year’s \npurchase.\nNet profit = Gross income – Outgoings \n4. Valuation based on cost In this approach, the actual cost of the constructed property \nis found after allowing for necessary depreciation and the resulting figure is taken as the \nvalue of the property.\n5. Development method of valuation In this method, the anticipated value of a property is \nobtained by multiplying the net income with the year’s purchase. The property mentioned \nabove includes those which are not at present in good condition, needing additions, \nalterations, improvements etc. In such a case, the value can be obtained upon anticipating \nthe future net income from it.\n6. Depreciation method of valuation It is worth to discuss the above method in detail. \nDepreciation refers to gradual loss of the value of a property due to wear and tear, \nexcess usage, improper handling, age, etc. Depreciation technique involves collecting or \nproviding an amount equal to the loss due to depreciation every year, separately from the \nprofit. So that, when the property is sold at the end (scrap value) it can be replaced by a \nnew one with the scrap value and the total depreciation amount."

The required passage may be for road, \nrailway, canal, pipeline, cycle track or pedestrians.\n \nThe branch of civil engineering which deals with the design, planning construction and \nmaintenance of bridges is known as bridge engineering.\n6.2 NeCessiTY OF Bridges\nBridges are vital for the development of a country since these enable transporting materials \nfrom one area to the other which may be separated by streams and rivers, thereby \nmaintaining uniform flow of essential goods for development. In times of war, materials \nare swiftly transported for the defence needs of the country by railroad bridges. Bridges \nlink the whole country with road and railway communication maintaining a uniform flow \nof people, goods and other essential commodities. The necessity of bridges may therefore \nbe summarised as follows:\n \n1. Bridges enable the free flow of traffic during monsoons and other periods of \ninclement weather.\n \n2. Bridges provide additional communication facilities.\n \n3. The development of the backward districts which may be rich agriculturally \ncritically depends on the existence of bridges.\n \n4. Bridges provide more socio-economic benefits to the people.\n \n5. Bridges also enable movement of troops and military vehicles during hostilities.\n6.3 siTe iNVesTigATiON \n[May, June 2013]\nBefore a bridge is constructed, a suitable site is selected based on certain factors which have \nbearing on the economy and stability of the bridge. Reconnaissance is therefore made and \nthe following data are recorded to determine the feasibility of bridge construction:"

    "clean_text": "Basic Civil and Mechanical Engineering\n6.2\n \nConsidered while selecting the site for a bridge are the following:\n \n1. The bridge should cross the river at right angles to the direction of flow of stream \nor river water so as to minimise the length of the bridge.\n \n2. The banks on either sides of the river should have firm soil and be straight and \nwell-defined. This will increase the stability of the bridge and reduce the possibility \nof the erosion of the banks. Also, the soil need not be stabilised or given any other \ntreatment which will increase the cost.\n \n3. The selected site should be at a place where the river is narrow and the flow is \nstreamlined without serious whirls and cross currents. Small width reduces the \nlength of the bridge which means less cost of construction and maintenance. If the \nflow of water is uniform and parallel, it is a reliable guard against scour.\n \n4. Precautions should be taken to see that the selected site should be far away from \nwhere the river is likely to change the course. If the bridge has been constructed \nand the river has changed its course, the bridge will be rendered useless.\n \n5. Hard inerodable strata or rock should be available close to the river-bed level.\n \n6. There should not be any sharp curves in road approaches.\n6.4 Preliminary Data To Be Collected\n[May, June 2013]\nThe engineer in-charge of the investigation for a bridge should collect the following \ninformation before the construction of a bridge is undertaken:\n1. Volume and Nature of Traffic Not only the present volume and nature of traffic but also \nthe future volume which is expected in the next ten years should be collected. The size \nand the type of the bridge required depend on this data.\n2. Velocity of the Stream and High Flood Level (HFL) Attained The discharge of water \npassing through the bridge depends on the velocity of water. It will help in designing the \nproper size of the waterway and pier thickness. The velocity of the stream during high \nflood and also during normal flow can be determined with the help of the current meter \nor velocity rods. The High Flood Level (HFL) will enable a bridge engineer to determine \nthe height of free board which is the height of the road way above the HFL. It is necessary \nto prevent the washing away of the bridge during heavy floods.\n3. Catchment Area It is an area of that portion of watershed from which water flows and \nfeeds the river. This is necessary to calculate the discharge of the stream.\n4. Strength and Nature of Soil and Extent and Type of Vegetation The depth of foundation \nfor the piers and abutments depends on the strength of soil. This is determined by carrying \nout borings at several places and testing the soil samples. Extent and type of vegetation \nalong with climatic conditions are also noted.\n5. Frequency of Flood Occurrence and Rainfall Details The determination of flood frequency \nis an important factor as most of the bridges are designed for a flood frequency of 50 years. \nAmount of rainfall and the HFL are also noted for future design."

Generally, the water \nface of these walls is kept vertical.\nFoundations The lowest artificially built parts of piers, abutments, etc., which are in direct \ncontact with the subsoil supporting the structure are called foundations.\n \nThe factors which affect the selection of foundation include the type of soil, the nature of \nsoil, the type of the bridge, the velocity of water and the superimposed load on the bridge.\n \nWell foundation is the most commonly adopted bridge foundation in India. The \nfoundation may consist of a single large diameter well or a group of smaller wells of \ncircular or other shapes.\nApproaches These are the lengths of communication route at both ends of the bridge. \nApproaches may be in embankment or in cutting depending upon the design of the \nbridge. It is recommended (as per Indian Road Congress) that the approaches must be \nstraight for a minimum length of 16 m on either side of the bridge. Its function is to carry \nthe communication route up to the floor level of the bridge. \nHand Rails and Guard Stones Hand rails are provided on both sides of a bridge to prevent \nany vehicle from falling into the stream. Footpaths are also provided for pedestrians to \nwalk along without interfering with the heavy vehicular traffic.\n \nIn order to prevent a vehicle from striking the parapet wall or the hand rails, guard \nstones painted white are provided along the edge of the footpaths at the ends of the road \nsurface. Guard stones are also provided along both sides of the approach roads in filling \nto prevent the vehicles from toppling over the sides of the embankments.\nBearings for the Girders The longitudinal girders have to rest over the piers which bear \nthe thrust of the load coming over them. In order that the girder ends should rest on \nproper seats, the same are provided with bearing blocks made of cement concrete, so that \nthe load may be uniformly distributed over the structure on which they rest. Due to the \nexpansion and contraction of the longitudinal girders during severe heat and cold, rollers \nare provided on the abutment ends to allow the movements without causing the girder \nto buckle.\n6.6 Technical Terms\n \n1.

They are as follows:\n \n1. The stored water in the dam can be conveniently used for irrigation purposes.\n \n2. The reservoir forms a very good source for water supply in areas where groundwater \nsource is inadequate.\n \n3. If sufficient head of water is stored, then that can be used for power generation \n(hydel power).\n \n4. In case of heavy floods, if water is left unobstructed, the result will be very \nhazardous involving irrecoverable loss of lives of human beings, animals, etc., and \nloss of property. A dam across the river can act as a good flood-control measure by \nonly letting out the excess quantity of water.\n \n5. A dam with its green surroundings forms an excellent place for recreation purposes \nsuch as boating, swimming and water skiing.\n \n6. The reservoir forms a good place for the breeding of fish, which is a considerable \nwealth from dam. Fish are bred by the pisciculture department.\n \n7. Besides the above-mentioned purposes, a dam serves many miscellaneous \npurposes, such as adding beauty to the place where it is located and making it \na place of tourism importance. The atmospheric heat around the reservoir and \nits surroundings is controlled well due to the large exposed area of water in the \nreservoir.\n7.3 Components Of A Reservoir\n \n1. A dam across a river/valley forms a pool of water on the upstream side with \nnecessary sluices to let out water.\n \n2. Irrigation canals taking off from one/either side of the dam with necessary outlets \nto control the flow in the canal.\n \n3. Spillway to let out the excess water from the dam which otherwise may result in \nbreach of the dam itself due to overstorage of water. Therefore, the spillway acts as \na safety valve of the dam.\n \n4. A good earthen bond in case of a totally artificially made reservoir.\n \n5. Ancillary works like fish ladder, log chutes, etc.\n7.4 Selection Of Site\n[Nov, Dec 2014; apr, may 2015, Regulation 2008]\nThe selection of a suitable site for a concrete dam depends on many factors, which are \ndetailed below.\nAvailability and Characteristics of Materials for Construction It is necessary for economic \nconsideration that the materials required for the dam should be available in close vicinity \nto the site.

Good water availability with minimum \nfluctuations is a desirable feature.\nIrrigation Command The dam site should be above the area to be irrigated.\nLocality Healthy surroundings free from mosquitoes are preferable.\nSediment Load An assurance that the dam would not silt soon is a desirable factor. The \nsediment load in the stream should be as little as possible.\nSpillway Site In the case of a masonry dam, it is not essential that a good site for spillway \nbe available. If available, it will be advantageous.\nSubmergence The value of the property and land submerged by the proposed dam should \nbe low in comparison to the benefits expected from the dam. For example, the height of \nRihand dam in Uttar Pradesh (India) could not be raised as the neighbouring Singarelli \ncoal mines are under danger of being submerged.\nTopography and Storage Capacity For the economic feasibility of a storage project it is \nnecessary that the length of the barrier or dam should be as small as possible and for a \ngiven height, it should store a good volume of water. Hence the river valley at the dam \nsite should be as narrow as possible and should open out upstream to provide a reservoir \nas shown in Fig. 7.1.\n7.5 Classification Of Dams\n[Nov, Dec 2009; may, June 2011]\nDams are broadly classified into two categories — rigid dams and non-rigid dams."

Earth dams Earth dams are made of soil with minimum processing using primitive \nequipment. These are built in areas where the foundation is not strong enough to bear the \nweight of a gravity dam. As the construction material of this dam is ordinary soil which \nis cheaply available, the cost of construction will be less than that of a rigid dam. These \ncan be constructed in places of low or moderate rainfall which necessitate only moderate \nheights for the dam.\n \nThe three different types of earth dams are described here.\n(a) Homogeneous embankment type When only one type of material is economically or \nlocally available, such homogeneous embankments are possible. This is the simplest type \nof an earth dam consisting of a single material throughout the structure.\n \nA purely homogeneous type poses the problem of seepage which is not desirable from \nthe stability point of view. Sometimes stones will be pitched over the upstream face of the \ndam to safeguard the dam against wave action and to improve the stability as shown in \nFig. 7.8.\nFree board\nHfl\nD/S side\nLine of saturation\nRivetment\nBed level\nFig. 7.8 Homogeneous earth dam\n(b) Zoned embankment type The section of a zoned embankment earth dam will have an \ninner zone made of impervious soil and an outer zone made of pervious soil as detailed in \nFig. 7.9. Normally, inner zone will be of clay or silt or a mixture of both and the outer zone \nis of locally available soil. The presence of inner impervious zone provides added strength \nand reduces seepage of water through the dam section. This type can be adopted for \ndams of greater heights. A suitable filter medium in the form of transition filter combined \nwith toe filter is provided. The provision of above filters will ensure proper collection of \nthe water seeping through the dam section and conveyance of the collected water to the \ndownstream side safely adds to the stability of the dam."

Nuclear power plants, thermal power plants, chemical \nconversion plants, etc., also emit solid, liquid and gaseous pollutants in the environment. \nThe gaseous pollutants cause global environmental problems like global warming and \ngreenhouse effect. Some important environmental constraints of power generation are \ngiven below.\n(i) Particulate Matter Solid or liquid particles present in the air are called particulate \nmatter.

Dust and fly ash emitted from the \npower plants are the significant sources of particulate matter in air.\n(ii) Acid Rain, Acid Snow, Acid Fog and Dry Acidic Deposition Increased concentrations \nof sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere cause these global \nenvironmental effects.\n(iii) Greenhouse Effect A greenhouse has transparent glass panes, which allow sunlight \nto enter and prevent exit of heat, CO2 and moisture.

As a result, every country needs to develop technologies which make \nuse of non-conventional sources of energy such as solar, wind, tidal and geothermal.\n \nIn spite of the enormous distance between the sun and earth, the radiation output \nby the sun is very powerful. The earth is shielded from harmful effects of radiation by \nthe atmosphere which surrounds the earth and particularly by the ozone layer in the \nstratosphere. It has been estimated that the earth receives about 1018 kWh of solar energy \nevery year. The total worldwide annual energy requirement is about 80 × 1012 kWh.

The world is trying to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions after the Kyoto Summit on Climate Change in 1997 and the ministerial \nmeeting in Buenos Aires in 1998. Today, the use of solar energy for power generation is \ngetting intense attention, because it is eco-friendly. At present, the cost of converting solar \npower into electricity may be high, but it is expected to come down in future.\n \nRecently, a British company has developed a system which uses fixed concave mirrors \nto trap and concentrate the solar energy which heats the air to about 1000°C. This hot \nair in turn drives a gas turbine generating electricity. One such system built on the \nMediterranean island of Crete employs 800 m2 of mirrors fixed at ground level producing \n35 kW of power. This system can be installed in remote villages, hospitals and hotels. It \ncan also be used to desalinate water for air-conditioning and cooking. \n \nThe direct conversion of solar energy into electricity is made possible by using the \nphotovoltaic effect in certain materials. The basic unit of photovoltaic system is the solar \ncell. The first practical solar cell was produced in 1954 by Bell Telephone Laboratories \nin USA. This cell was made from a single crystal silicon. A solar cell is a semiconductor \ndevice processed and fabricated in a manner which permits the generation of voltage \nwhen light falls on it. The voltage is capable of driving an electric current through an \nexternal circuit. \n \nThe power from the solar cells can be used for the operation of a calculator, pump set, \nradio station, TV station, satellite, etc. The power obtained in the day time can be stored \nin solar batteries.

At the mouth of the Rance river in France, a tidal plant with a \ncapacity of 240 MW is producing electricity for commercial use since 1966.\n \nIndia’s first tidal power plant, the Kachchh Tidal Power Project, the biggest project of \nits kind in the world, is to be built at Navlakhi near Kandla port in Gujarat. The expected \npower to be generated in this project is about 850 MW from 34 generating sets of 25 MW \neach. As per the estimate in 1991, the cost of the project is about Rs 1150 crore.\n \nA tidal power plant mainly consists of the following:\n \n1. A barrage with gates and sluices\n \n2.

The average \nincrease in temperature with depth under the earth is 1°C for every 30–40 m. At a depth \nof 10–15 km, the earth’s interior is as hot as l000–1200°C. In certain areas of our planet, \nthe underground heat has raised the temperature of water to over 200°C which bursts out \nas hot steam through the cracks in the earth’s crust. These are called thermal springs. This \nsteam can be used for the generation of electric power. Boreholes are normally sunk with \na depth up to 1000 m releasing steam and water at temperatures ranging from 200–300°C \nand pressure up to 30 bar. Steam is transmitted by pipelines to the power station. Due to \nlow steam pressure, the station efficiency is only 10 to 15 per cent."

The warm surface water was at 25°C. The cold water at 11°C was \ntapped by a long pipe. As the Claude plant used an open cycle in early times, the open \ncycle system is sometimes referred to as ‘Claude cycle’. In the open cycle, the condensate \nneed not return to the evaporator.

Later, in the closed \ncycle, working fluids such as ammonia, propane or freon with higher vapour pressures at \nthe temperatures available were used.\n \nThe most recent design on the closed-cycle OTEC system was done by Anderson and \nAnderson in the l960s. Hence, the closed cycle is sometimes referred to as ‘Anderson cycle’. \nThey used propane as the working fluid, with a 20°C temperature difference between the \nwarm surface and cold water.

Due \nto forced circulation, the rate of heat transfer and the evaporative capacity of the boiler are increased. \nThis boiler is highly suitable for a power plant and this has a high thermal efficiency. \nNormally, in high-pressure boilers, either furnace oil or solid fuel in a pulverised form is \nused in the furnace.

When a heat engine is not able to convert all the input heat \nenergy into useful mechanical power, it would be obviously rejecting energy as waste \nheat. So, a system will become more efficient if the waste heat is utilised for some useful \npurpose. Any scheme which combines electrical power generation with utilisation of heat \nfor industrial processes and/or space heating is referred to as Combined Heat and Power \n(CHP) or Cogeneration. In such a scheme, energy wastage is reduced to the minimum \nthereby increasing the overall thermal efficiency. \n \nRefer to Fig. 9.8. This cogeneration power plant employs both the steam turbine and a \ngas turbine for generating electric power. Because of recovery of heat from the flue gases \nof the boiler and the exhaust gases from the gas turbine, we obtain high overall thermal \nefficiency. \n \nSteam is generated at high pressure and temperature in the boiler. Steam from the boiler \nis fed to the main steam turbine for generating electric power and also to a small turbine \nwhich drives the feed water pump. Both the turbines are back pressure, non-condensing \ntype and the steam in the last stages of the turbines is fed into the desalination plant to \npurify sea water for getting soft water. Thus, it is noted that the desalination plant is \noperated by using the heat from the exhaust or waste steam from the turbines."

The \nhot exhaust from the gas turbine is made to heat the condensate feed water from the \ndesalination plant. The above two waste heat recoveries help in increasing the thermal \nefficiency of the power plant by reducing the fuel burnt in the gas turbine combustion \nchamber and also in the boiler for the same output power. \n \nTo site an example, in the case of a gas turbine power plant, heat from the exhaust gases \ncould be made use of in the waste heat recovery boiler.

The collapsing of these bubbles trigger intense \nshockwaves inside the pump, causing significant damage to the impeller and/or the \npump housing. Cavitation may be classified in ways as follows: \nSuction Cavitation When a pump is operating under low pressure or vacuum conditions, \nsuction cavitation occurs. The pump is not receiving enough flow of fluid. Cavitation is \nindicated by formation of bubbles, which may lead to the formation of cavities at the eye \nof the impeller. As the bubbles carry over to the discharge side of the pump, the fluid \nconditions change, compressing the bubble into liquid and causing it to implode against \nthe face of the impeller. The cavitation affected impeller will have small and large pits \nand will look like a sponge. Possible causes of suction cavitation are (i) Clogged filters or \nstrainers, (ii) Blockage in the pipe, (iii) Pump is running too far right on the pump curve \nand (iv) Poor piping design. \nDischarge Cavitation If a pump’s discharge pressure is extremely high, or runs at less \nthan 10% of its best efficiency point (BEP), discharge cavitation may occur. The high \ndischarge pressure makes it difficult for the fluid to flow out of the pump, so it circulates \ninside the pump. Liquid flows between the impeller and the housing at very high velocity, \ncausing a vacuum at the housing wall and the formation of bubbles. The implosion of \nthose bubbles trigger intense shockwaves, causing premature wear of the impeller tips \nand pump housing. As the worst case, discharge cavitation can cause the breakage of \nthe impeller shaft. Possible causes of discharge cavitation are (i) Blockage in the pipe on \ndischarge side, (ii) Clogged filters or strainers, (iii) Running too far left on the pump curve \nand (iv) Poor piping design.\nShort-Answer Questions\n \n1.

As the source of heat energy from combustion of a fuel, engines are \nclassified as External Combustion (EC) engines and Internal Combustion (IC) engines. In \nthe EC engines, combustion of the fuel takes place outside the engine and in the IC engines, \ncombustion of the fuel takes place inside the engine. Popular External Combustion (EC) \nengines are the steam engines that are used in locomotives and ships. Petrol engines and \ndiesel engines are classified as internal combustion engines, abbreviated as IC engines. \nThese engines have extensive applications in transport by road, rail, sea and air. These \nare made use of in motorcycles, scooters, cars, buses, lorries, railway engines, ships and \naero engines. IC engines have made a major revolution in transport. These engines have \nalso contributed to the development of agriculture through tractors, harvesters, etc. IC \nengines also play a vital role in major construction work through bulldozers and other \nequipment. Thus, development of IC engines has made a great contribution to human \ncomfort and to the tremendous progress of agriculture and industry. It is surprising and \nrather unbelievable that about 120 years back, there was no IC engine at all in any part \nof the world. Obviously, due to the rapid development in science and technology in the \nrecent years, the present generation enjoys more comfort than our ancestors.\n \nBut, the world is going to face a crisis for fuel in about 50 years when the crude oil in the \nGulf countries is expected to be exhausted. Under these circumstances, leading automobile \ncompanies in the world are investing huge amounts in research and development to find \nalternate source to replace diesel and petrol.\n11.2 Classification Of Ic Engines\n \n[May 2012; May 2015, Regulation 2013; Apr 2015, Regulation 2013]\nIC engines can be classified as follows:\n \n1.

Sometimes, a liner made of alloy cast iron is \ninserted into the cylinder which can be replaced when worn out.\n2. Cylinder Head It is fitted on the top of the cylinder. A gasket is provided between the \ncylinder and the cylinder head to prevent the leakage of hot gases. The cylinder head also \naccommodates the inlet valve, the exhaust valve, and the spark plug or injector.\n3. Piston It transmits the force exerted by the burning gases to the connecting rod and \nfinally to the crank shaft. The piston is usually made of cast iron or steel or aluminium \nalloy. There is an interesting and complex science behind the design and manufacture of a \npiston of an IC engine. The diameter of a piston in a large marine engine is about 1 m.\n4. Piston Rings Two different types of piston rings are housed in the circumferential \ngrooves provided on the outer surface of the piston. The function of upper rings known \nas compression rings is to provide gas-tight sealing to maintain the compression pressure \ninside the cylinder and to prevent the leakage of burnt gases into the crank case. The \nfunction of the lower rings is to scrap the used lubricating oil into the crank case. These \nrings are called scraper rings.\n5. Connecting Rod This transmits the force from the piston to the crank shaft. It also helps \nin converting the reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotary motion of the crank \nshaft. For the lubrication of the piston pin in the connecting rod, a small hole is provided \nfrom the big end to the small end. The small end of the connecting rod is attached to the \npiston by a gudgeon pin.\n6. Crank Shaft Great care should be taken in the proper design of the crank shaft. Alloy \nsteels are used for the crank shaft to withstand the high stress and strain. The crank shaft \nis provided with suitable holes to help in the lubrication system. The crank case serves as \na sump for the lubricating oil.\n7. Flywheel It is mounted on the crank shaft. The flywheel stores the excess energy \nduring the power stroke of the engine and helps the movement of the piston during the \nremaining idle strokes.\n8.

To indicate the amount of fuel in \nthe tank, a fuel gauge is provided which operates by means of a float mechanism. As the \nfuel has to pass through a fine hole in the carburetter, the petrol should be first filtered. \nAs the petrol tank is at a lower level than the carburetter, the petrol is pumped by a small \n-capacity diaphragm pump by a cam mechanism driven by the crankshaft.\n11.10.1 Carburetter\nThis can be considered as the heart of a petrol engine.

It is well known that heat can spontaneously flow from higher temperature \nto a lower temperature. However, for heat to flow in the reverse direction, the second law \nof thermodynamics stipulates that external work/energy should be supplied.\n \nNormally, the refrigeration systems are classified on the basis of the capacity of the \nunit. The domestic refrigerators are classified based on the volume (number of litres), \nwhile the air conditioning systems are classified by their load (tons of refrigeration). In \ncase of the deep freezers, the systems are identified with volume and lowest temperatures \nthat can be obtained. The systems can also be classified according to the mode of working \nas refrigerator or heat pump.\n12.2 Unit Of Refrigeration\n \n[Nov 2012; may 2014, 2015, Regulation 2008]\nThe unit of refrigeration is called ‘Ton of Refrigeration’ (TR) which is defined as the \nquantity of heat to be removed to produce one ton of ice at 0°C, within 24 hours when the \ninitial condition of water is also at 0°C. In the SI units, 1 TR is equivalent to 210 kJ/min or \n3.5 kW.

Therefore, the refrigerant \nvapour is condensed into high pressure liquid. \n \nThe liquid refrigerant enters the expansion device which can be a long spirally wound \ncapillary tube in small refrigerators.

This system eliminates the compressor, yet produces the \ncompressor effect by the combined effects provided by an absorber, a pump and a generator. \nThe pump consumes comparatively lesser amount of electric power and the generator can \nbe operated by heat energy obtained from the burning of any low-cost fuel or any heat source \nincluding solar energy.\n \nThe schematic diagram of a simple vapour absorption system is shown in Fig. 12.3. \nThe refrigerant used is ammonia and the absorber is water. Ammonia vapour coming \nout from the evaporator at low pressure is absorbed by water available in the absorber \ntank resulting in a strong ammonia solution. The pump pumps the solution, thereby \nincreasing its pressure and sends the high-pressure solution into the generator. In the \ngenerator, the solution is healed by external heat supply. Now, high-pressure ammonia \ngas is generated which enters the condenser. The weak ammonia solution available in \nthe generator contains more amount of water. It goes back to the absorber tank where it \nabsorbs the incoming ammonia vapour and becomes once again a strong solution. The \nprocesses taking place in the condenser, expansion device and the evaporator are similar \nto those discussed under Section 12.8.1. \n \nThe absorber used in the vapour-absorption refrigeration system should have high \naffinity for the refrigerant, remain in the liquid phase under the operating conditions and \nshould possess high boiling point, low specific heat and good chemical stability.\nGenerator\nCondenser\nEvaporator\nExpansion\nvalve\nHeat\nsupplied\nPump\nabsorber\nfig. 12.3 Vapour-absorption refrigerator"

The author has experienced up to \n–27°C in USA. during the period of his stay from 1956 – 58 at Purdue University. Similarly, \nwhen we are flying at an altitude of about 10,000 metres, the temperature surrounding the \naircraft will be several degrees below 0°C, due to which the passengers’ area should be \nwarmed up.\n12.12 Applications Of Air Conditioning\n \n1.

The increased humidity causes difficulty in disposing of body heat. Also, the \nroom temperature rises due to the heat dissipated from the human body and heat gains \nfrom light source and any other equipment. When the room temperature is high, it causes \nhuman discomfort.\n \nIt has been found that for human comfort we need a dry-bulb temperature of 20°C \nand relative humidity of 60 per cent in the room. Any air-conditioning system should \nprimarily be able to achieve the above said conditions inside the room.\n \nUnder normal living conditions, a person inhales about 0.65 m3 of oxygen and exhales \nabout 0.2 m3 of carbon dioxide in an hour. If the CO2 level in the room increases above \ntwo per cent, it will cause human discomfort. Hence, the air conditioner should supply \nenough quantity of fresh air called ventilation air to meet the oxygen requirements and \nmaintain the CO2 level within limits. Also, the conditioned air should have a velocity \nin the range of 8 m/min to 14 m/min and be properly distributed inside the room for \na feeling of comfort. Further requirements of comfort air conditioning demand that the \nconditioned air be free from dust, bacteria, odour and toxic gases."
